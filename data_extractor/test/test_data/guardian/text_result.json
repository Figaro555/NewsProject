  "Svitlana and her son Danylo had been in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro for less then a day when a terrible realisation struck her: without money, the offer of work or a permanent place to stay they would have to return to their apartment in Sloviansk, where the frontline of the war was drawing closer and the sounds of Russian bombardment growing ever louder.Early that morning they had packed their belongings into two bags and left the room they rented in a communal apartment in Sloviansk. Volunteers drove them to the only functioning regional station, in Pokrovsk, where they boarded the daily evacuation train.Svitlana walks by the crater left by a shell in Sloviansk on 13 July. Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianIt was the second time they had run from war. In 2014 they had left their home in Horlivka after Russian forces occupied the town. Svitlana’s husband had been killed by shrapnel and she said the new authorities refused to compensate her, recording his death as a heart attack.They had been told they would be given tokens on the train which they could exchange in Dnipro for relocation money – £60 for Svitlana and £120 for Danylo. But for some reason people on their carriage didn’t receive their tokens.They were greeted by a group of Pentecostal churchgoers in Dnipro who took them to a Pentecostal prayer house-turned shelter. But it became clear that evening that Svitlana was expected to move on from the church after a few nights.Svitlana and Danylo with their backs to the camera as they registered at an IDP shelter at the Light of the Gospel Church in Dnipro. Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/The Guardian“Here they want £300 for a room, it’s just completely unrealistic,” she said, referring to rental prices in Dnipro. “If I just had more time then I could find work, but we’ll be on the rubbish dump. I know people who have been waiting three months for their displaced person (benefits).”Even when Ukrainians are able to flee towns under bombardment, a lack of money and financial support is sending many back.“We don’t have any relatives,” Svitlana said, And in this world, everything is about money.”The next day they were given a lift back to Sloviansk, first from volunteers who dropped them in another town, Kramatorsk, and then from Ukrainian soldiers who picked them up from the side of the motorway.Svitlana and her son Danylo in Sloviansk on 13 July. Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianOver the last week and a half conditions in Sloviansk have worsened considerably.Since 4 July, Svitlana and Danylo have been living in a basement of an old factory next to their house, which is reinforced with steel rods. Svitlana said they have only been able to go outside four times in the last 10 days. The basement is damp, there is no phone signal and all of Danylo’s neighbourhood friends have left. He is the last child in the club of residential buildings where they live.About 20,000 people are left in the town, a fall of more than 80% since the spring, when the town’s mayor urged residents to leave as Russia began advancing into the remaining Ukrainian-controlled areas of the Donbas, the collective name for Donetsk and Luhansk provinces.Svitlana’s remaining neighbours – about a dozen out of several hundred – also blamed a combination of temporary accommodation elsewhere and a lack of work for not leaving.“Where should we go?,” Svitlana said. “If they gave me a house, OK. But after a month, I’ll be on the streets. I’d rather stay here where I know people. Who’s going to help in Lviv?”There has been no running water in Sloviansk for over six weeks and no gas for even longer, say Svitlana and her neighbours. The electricity supply can come and go, meaning they sometimes use makeshift grills they have made outside their building instead of their plug-in stoves. There are only a few food shops still open and there is almost no work to speak of.Svitlana and her neighbour change the blankets on a bed. Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianSvitlana has not received a salary since the corner shop where she worked closed because of the war. Their neighbour Natalia, who worked at the local psychiatric hospital, said her state salary was reduced from £180 to about £50 a month in March and was cut entirely in May.The frontline is now just 10 kilometres from Sloviansk, which is said to be the next big town in Russia’s sights. Since early July, the town has experienced days where the shelling has been constant, Svitlana said. On one occasion the market was hit. Footage of the immediate aftermath showed local people and soldiers pulling bodies from the burning stalls.Successful Ukrainian strikes in the past week on Russian ammunition depots seem to have slowed the bombardment. However, the Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War assesses that the Russians will probably launch a larger-scale and more determined offensive towards Sloviansk soon.Shortly after they returned from Dnipro, a farmer north of Sloviansk, next to the frontlines, offered them £5 for a day’s work cherrypicking. Svitlana, Danylo and her neighbours went on his truck but said they had to hit the floor twice as fighter jets and rockets flew over the orchard from the Russian side.“We all club together here and put what we can in for meals – one person has a carrot, another some rice,” said Svitlana. “What I don’t understand is there’s all this money coming in from the west but no one comes here, apart from the council workers who bring water.”",

  "Robert Lewandowski has signed a four-year deal with Barcelona, which means he probably has a good 18 months before they ask him to take a wage cut. Give or take. Naturally a good deal depends on how much deeper into their financial quarry Barcelona have managed to dig themselves in the meantime. Perhaps, alternatively, Lewandowski will be asked to defer a portion of his salary, or maybe amortise it into 420 easy monthly instalments, or accept payment in the form of $BAR fan tokens.This is the perk of being the world’s biggest and most incoherent club: there is always another lever to squeeze. Bankrolled by the partial sale of their broadcast rights for the next 25 years, Barcelona have brought Lewandowski, Raphinha, Franck Kessié and Andreas Christensen to the Camp Nou this summer. César Azpilicueta, Jules Koundé and Bernardo Silva are also being pursued. In a way this is the most mystifying part of Barcelona’s spending spree, over and above the question of where the money is coming from. What sane player would join this ridiculous club in the first place? What have they been told? And just what, exactly, are Barcelona playing at?How are Barcelona still able to buy players? – Football Weekly ExtraRead moreIt is just under six months since the president, Joan Laporta, held an extraordinary press conference unveiling the results of an internal audit that discovered evidence of false accounting, forging of documents, unexplained payments to third parties and colossal financial mismanagement. Debts were running at close to £1bn. Player wages required a substantial cut to comply with La Liga regulations. Nevertheless, Laporta also had some proud news to report: the signing of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was on the verge of being completed by the end of the week.This curious doublethink – “we’re broke, new signings incoming!” – has persisted into the summer. Never mind that two new forwards were hardly the priority for a squad already boasting Aubameyang, Memphis Depay, Ousmane Dembélé, Ferran Torres and Ansu Fati. Never mind that senior players are being pressed to take another pay cut, after many agreed wage reductions during the pandemic. Never mind that the sale of Frenkie de Jong to Manchester United is being held up by around £17m in owed wages. This is Barcelona, where the sun always rises and the party never stops.The consensus within the game – from fans, from agents, even from rival clubs – is that Barcelona’s spending defies sense, that it is a doomed and deeply irresponsible gamble on their future, perhaps even a form of betrayal. That given the rich pipeline of talent flowing from La Masia, Barcelona could simply have made a virtue of their straitened circumstances and allowed Xavi to build a new squad around the rich academy talent of Pedri, Gavi and Riqui Puig. There may be a good deal of logic in all this. But to shake a fist at Barcelona for living beyond their means is really to misunderstand what motivates this club, what turns the wheels of modern football, a world where logic only occasionally impinges.A Barcelona fan in Poland urges Robert Lewandowski to join her team. The forward has now completed his move from Bayern Munich. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesLaporta may be many things but he is not stupid. What he recognises, above all, is that Barcelona’s future is not necessarily tied up in financial probity or sound business sense or even trophy accumulation but in self-projection. The last pre-pandemic accounts showed that Barcelona derive just 18% of income from matchday revenue. Most of the rest – the television subscriptions, the Spotify sponsorship deal, the merchandise, the global network of soccer schools, renting out the Camp Nou pitch for weddings – is not remotely contingent on Barcelona winning anything. It relies purely on Barcelona being Barcelona: the brand, the behemoth, the myth.In a way Barcelona are no longer building a football team. They are selling a story. The loss of Lionel Messi was devastating on a sporting and emotional level but much worse was the brand damage: the pall of decline, the sense that this giant of the game might no longer be an ultimate destination. And so only a response of equal and opposite magnitude would suffice. The idea of recasting itself a smaller, better-run club is antithetical to every commercial principle the modern Barcelona stand for. Grasp this, and everything else follows.Robert Lewandowski credits ‘amazing’ Xavi for decision to join BarcelonaRead moreIn any case, look further afield and you may wonder what possible motivation Barcelona might have for conducting themselves more modestly. Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City have demonstrated the effectiveness of disregarding financial strictures and essentially forcing the rest of the sport to bend to their hubris and might. Manchester United spend the best part of a decade ignoring the future and simply get richer and richer. Saying one thing and then doing another is the foundation stone of modern politics. Contracts are routinely signed for five years and ripped up after 12 months and any player who wants them honoured can simply be framed as lazy, selfish or mercenary.Nothing really means anything. Failures are never really punished. Gambles are never really gambles. Twelve of the world’s biggest clubs try to destroy European football and their punishment is simply to let them back in and give them another go. Miss out on the Champions League and you can get the rules changed in your favour. In these circumstances, why would you not conclude that might makes right, that the good times will keep on rolling, that money is whatever you say it is?Sign up for The Fiver.The most disastrous season in Barcelona’s recent history ended with a second-placed finish, a record sponsorship deal and now, the signing of the best striker in the world.

  "Some of the most extreme weather globally is currently happening in the UK, which is in the middle of an exceptional and unprecedented heatwave. The UK’s highest observed temperature previously stood at 38.7C (101.7F), which was set in Cambridge in July 2019.The UK maximum temperature record is expected to be broken again on Tuesday but at numerous weather stations across central and eastern England. The widespread nature of this heat is staggering. Another notable feature of the current heatwave is the very high overnight temperatures forecast on Monday night. Many places are expected to record a “tropical night” where the temperature does not drop below 20C.England, Scotland and Wales are also all expected to set new individual nation records on the same day, and potentially by a large amount. Wales has the potential for its previous high of 35.2C in Hawarden, Flintshire, to be completely smashed, with the possibility that north-east Wales will reach about 37C-38C.Weather tracker: Europe’s heatwave sends temperature records tumblingRead moreSimilarly, the 32.9C recorded in Greycrook in the Scottish Borders in 2003 should be comfortably beaten, with about 35C expected on Monday. Finally, the peak temperatures on Monday are likely to be in the 40C-41C range in central and eastern England – beating the 2019 English and UK record by about 2C.A cold front will spread in from the west during the next 24 hours, bringing the potential for thunderstorms. This will introduce much cooler air to all parts by Wednesday and will bring an end to the heatwave for the UK. Nevertheless, southern Europe will continue to experience above-average temperatures, in what is turning into an extremely hot summer for many parts of the continent.Meanwhile, much of northern and central Russia as well as Alaska are experiencing temperatures close to 10C below normal. High pressure to the north of Russia is helping pull cold air in from the north-east, while this relatively cold air is being wrapped within an area of low pressure across Alaska, keeping it relatively cold and also wet across southern and western areas in particular.",
  "Heather Small used to tell herself: if she could just have one song that everyone knew and expected her to sing over and over again, she would be happy. That she has many is a real delight. She remembers a group of refuse collectors in their van who spotted her on the street and shouted over to her. “They all started singing Moving on Up,” she says. “I felt like I’d arrived. It was brilliant. It was just so warm, and if the dustmen want to sing my songs I feel honoured.”That song and others – such as One Night in Heaven and Search for the Hero from her days in the band M People, and her solo hit Proud – are on her new album, largely of greatest hits, rerecorded with the London Metropolitan Orchestra. Proud, especially, has taken on a life of its own since its release in 2000, soundtracking TV montages, being used for the 2012 Olympic bid and appearing in the sitcom Miranda; even Oprah Winfrey used it on her show. Does Small ever get tired of it? “Absolutely not. Hearing the reaction from a crowd to Proud brings out the joy because I see how much it means to people. This song means so much to me, and that I’ve been able to translate that feeling, and people have made it their own, is joyous. How could you not give it your best? For some people, it’s the first time they’ve heard me sing. Others have heard me sing it lots of times, but they’re still waiting for that feeling, that connection.” She smiles, lips painted pink. “I’m looking for that connection as well.” It’s why she sings, she says. “You want to feel that love; you want to feel that joy. If you release something, if you put it out there, you’re looking for some kind of approval; you’re looking for people to be your tribe.”We meet in an office at her record label, and I can’t remember the last time I met anyone so lacking in cynicism, so quick to laugh, raucously, and often at herself. Her songs are warm, upbeat and energising, and Small is the personification of it. She doesn’t take herself seriously, but she always took her work seriously. In the 1990s M People had huge success commercially and critically, winning the 1994 Mercury prize for their second album, Elegant Slumming, up against giants such as Blur, Paul Weller, Take That, the Prodigy and Primal Scream. The 1990s pop scene “was fun”, says Small. “So many genres were allowed to coexist, very different but still bringing something very British to the table. I’m proud to be part of that because I own my Britishness now, in a way that I could not earlier in my life.”How did she deal with the fame and success? “I think you’re cushioned from it because you work so hard,” she says. Small never drank or smoked or took drugs, she says (she has also been vegan most of her life), and only went to one or two parties while on tour. “Mostly I thought: ‘I’m not on holiday. People have paid hard-earned money,’ and this is always my ethos. When the band pick up their instruments, if they’re feeling a bit fuzzy-headed you can’t always tell, but you can tell when a voice is tired, and there’s no hiding.”She felt it was her mission to impart the M People good vibes. Their fans, she says, “saw that we were having fun, and that we liked each other, and we were just going around the world with [our] friends. Singing, writing songs and trying to be as happy as you could be, because we all know unhappy doesn’t feel good.” Are they still friends? Do they still like one other? There is the slightest hint, amid all Small’s positivity, that they have moved on. “I don’t see them often. I would say my friend is Shovell [the band’s drummer]. He is my son’s godfather. We still keep in contact. The other two I don’t see so much or speak to. Sometimes you grow apart.”Small with fellow M People (from left) Mike Pickering, Shovell and Paul Heard, in 1996. Photograph: Ilpo Musto/ShutterstockIn 2000 Small released her solo album, Proud. Its title single – not an immediate hit but an enduring one – is special to her because she co-wrote it (most of M People’s songs were written by their founder member, Haçienda DJ Mike Pickering). Did she feel pressure to follow it up with another hit? It’s not about that, she says. “People would ask me when I was younger, what do you want? I used to say: ‘To still be singing.’ There’s no guarantee, as you get older, that you keep your voice. There’s no guarantee that people want to hear your voice. That was always my goal. The thing that hit records do is keep you in the game for a little bit longer. You want something to do well because you just love what you do, but I’ve never felt the pressure for it to be a massive hit, because first and foremost it has to be a hit with me.”From the start of her career, Small was very clear that she would only record songs she wanted to. As a child, and well into her 20s, she was shy, but it seemed to morph into a guardedness and a steely self-possession that, looking back, probably protected her as a young woman in the music industry. She loved singing and performing but she wasn’t desperate to be a pop star, so she wasn’t easily coerced, either by predatory men or simply into singing songs she didn’t want to. “I’ve never really done things for the money, so it’s quite hard for somebody, because of the character that I am, to sway me in any way,” she says.Being a Black female, people think to themselves: ‘You’re standoffish’ or ‘You’re a diva’. No, just shy! As a child, growing up in London, though, Small’s shyness meant nobody knew she wanted to be a singer. She would sing in the playground at school, and once her uncle passed her bedroom and heard her singing and told her to keep it up. “That was something that fed me for a long time,” she says. When she told a school careers counsellor she wanted to be a singer, they laughed. “A lot of the white teachers laughed at the Black children quite often at school,” she says. “They belittled your ideas and tried to belittle your confidence.”She once asked the music teacher if she could join the choir, and he dismissively asked if she could sing. “Nobody else auditioned,” she says. “I thought: ‘I’ll show you’, but you shouldn’t have to be tough and resilient at school.” She would push back at any sense she wasn’t being treated equally. Then, she says, “you get in trouble. You’re seen as a troublemaker.” It was the same later in the music industry, when she could be labelled “difficult” or hard work. “Being a Black female, people think to themselves: ‘You’re standoffish’ or ‘You’re a diva’. No, just shy! There are some Black women who are shy, but you don’t get attributed those kinds of …” She pauses. “People are quick to believe a negative.”Small’s parents had come to the UK in the early 1960s from Barbados. Her father worked as a bus conductor and was “very domineering”, she says. “He wasn’t a very nice man.” But her mother, who worked for a supermarket, was more loving. Both contributed to her resilience, she says: “Him because of the negative, and my mother because of the total positivity. She made my sister and I feel like we walked on clouds.” It was her mother – who lives with Small in west London now – who counteracted the racism Small experienced at school. “It’s like a flower: you face the light and that’s where you grow. My light was my mother and my sister at home.” Small realised, she says, “You have to find a way to empower yourself. And being shy wasn’t empowering so I had to get over it.”It wasn’t immediate. In her early 20s, she managed to put herself forward for an audition after seeing an advert in the music paper Melody Maker, and became the singer in the soul band Hot House. They didn’t have much chart success, but did support Barry White at the Royal Albert Hall. Small was terrified. “I didn’t move, and I closed my eyes for the entire thing.” She has battled stage fright throughout her career.Performing at the National Diversity Awards, in Liverpool, February 2022. Photograph: Shirlaine Forrest/Getty ImagesThe band were dropped by their record company three years later and she was devastated. “I thought, I’ve missed the boat. You don’t think you’re going to get a second chance,” she says. “That was the lowest I got and that’s what made me realise that I love singing, but I thought I’d have to do it on the side.” Instead, she was asked to provide vocals for M People. The idea was that the Manchester dance-pop band would be an ever-changing collective, with different vocalists, but Small fit perfectly and she joined the band permanently (around this time, legend has it she provided vocals for the re-recorded version of Black Box’s Ride on Time, though it has become something of a running joke that she refuses to confirm).In the 1990s it wasn’t easy to be a working mother in the music industry. Her son was born in 1997, and a few months later she was on tour with a baby. As a solo artist, she also became aware that space for Black female artists was limited. “Back in the day, I’d never be on the bill with another Black female performer. To this day it’s like, you don’t see more than one on the bill. You just think: why is that? Because everyone, especially my contemporaries, we all sound different, we sing different types of songs, and you just think that can’t be an accident. People used to say to me: ‘We got you instead of such and such.’ They tried to foster an air of competition, and I’d be like: ‘We’re friends.’ That stumps everybody: ‘You mean, you talk to each other?’ I’m like: ‘Not only do we talk to each other, we like each other.’”Romantic love, that can come and go. It paid off singing the love songs to my family and son because they still love meSmall released a second solo album in 2006, and for the next few years she concentrated on raising her son, whose father is Shaun Edwards, the former rugby league player (their son, James Small-Edwards, is a Labour and Co-operative councillor, who was elected for London’s Bayswater ward in May, helping Labour gain control over Westminster city council for the first time). Small and Edwards broke up when their son was a baby; another long-term relationship came to an end fairly recently. There is one single on her new album, Love Me Or Not, that is in her typically empowering style. “I used to shy away from out-and-out love songs,” she says. “When I used to sing any love song, I’d channel the love I have for my son; it would not be romantic love. Romantic love, that can come and go. Sometimes it’s here, sometimes it’s there, sometimes you’re looking all around for it.” She smiles. “Romantic love is not, for me, as present and consistent as family love. It paid off, singing the love songs to my family and son because they still love me; they’re still in my life.” She laughs, full-bodied and unselfconscious. “Oh dear, I’m making myself laugh.”Heather Small looks back: ‘James was born in March – by November he was with me on tour’Read moreAt the parade for the Queen’s platinum jubilee last month, Small appeared on one of the “national treasures” buses. Even now, at the age of 57, she wondered if she should do it: “I grew up thinking: ‘Do I belong?’” She endures constant reminders that the racism she experienced as a child hasn’t disappeared, but she is also adamant that you “don’t apologise for the space you take up”. When her son was born, it was the first time that she actively embraced her Britishness, she says. “I thought, I don’t want my son to grow up thinking: ‘Where do I belong?’ like I did. My son has got ties with Barbados. He goes there; he sees his family there. But he feels British, and he has the right to embrace these streets and be embraced, and if he’s not embraced he wants to know why.”So she took her place on the bus because, she says, she thought to herself: “If you don’t, when do you accept that you’re British?” She smiles. “There are so many things that I am, and I’ve learned over the years to embrace it all and I think that’s where my confidence has come from. Because I know what I am, and I’m proud of it.”Heather Small’s new album, Colour My Life, will be released on 5 August",

It said it has a licence to broadcast in the European Union and that it also has studios in Amsterdam, Paris and Tbilisi.“During the four and a half months that Dozhd wasn’t operating, a bloody and senseless war waged by Russian leaders against Ukraine has continued and people died and lives were destroyed,” the TV station said in a statement.“Today, more than ever, Russian citizens should have access to independent information,” it said, adding that the conflict “destroys Ukrainian cities and the future of Russia”.It said it would gradually increase its operations and broadcast through social media and television. Launched in 2008, TV Dozhd has actively covered Russia’s opposition and protest movements. In 2021, Russian authorities labelled it as a “foreign agent”, a status that placed it under heavy administrative constraints and put it at risk of heavy fines and being banned.Updated at 19.42 BST3h ago19.00SummaryThe time in Kyiv is 9pm.

He added that 651 criminal proceedings had been registered relating to high treason and collaboration by employees of prosecutors’ offices, pretrial investigation bodies and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nZelenskiy has appointed Vasyl Maliuk, an experienced security official and corruption fighter, as the acting head of the domestic security agency.\n\nForeign ministers from European Union countries have agreed another €500m (£425m) of EU funding to supply arms to Ukraine, taking the bloc’s security support to €2.5bn since February. “Today at the EU foreign ministers’ meeting, a political agreement was reached on the fifth tranche of military assistance to Ukraine,” Sweden’s minister for foreign affairs, Ann Linde, said in a statement, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will discuss the export of Ukrainian grain at their meeting in Tehran on Tuesday, a Kremlin aide has told reporters. The Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said officials from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations would most probably meet this week to discuss resuming Ukraine’s Black Sea grain exports.\n\nPutin said on Monday that it was impossible to cut Russia off from the rest of the world. He added that sanctions imposed by western countries would not turn the clock back on Russia’s development.\n\nA gas pipeline has been damaged as a result of a strike by the Ukrainian armed forces near the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant in Kherson, a region currently controlled by Russian forces, Tass has reported, citing the regional administration.\n\nRussia is preparing for the next stage of its offensive in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian military officials, after Moscow said its forces would step up military operations in “all operational areas”. The Ukrainian military said Russia appeared to be regrouping units for an offensive towards Sloviansk, a symbolically important city held by Ukraine in the eastern region of Donetsk. The British defence ministry added that Russia was also reinforcing its defensive positions across the occupied areas in southern Ukraine.\n\nSix people were killed in Russian shelling of the town of Toretsk in the Donetsk region of east Ukraine on Monday, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service.\nThat’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today.

Meanwhile, RWE, Germany’s largest power producer and another importer of Russian gas, also said it has received a force majeure notice.\n“Please understand that we cannot comment on its details or our legal opinion,” the company said.\nA source, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the force majeure concerned supplies through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, a major supply route to Germany and beyond.\nFlows through the pipeline are at zero as the link undergoes annual maintenance that began on 11 July and is meant to conclude on Thursday.Updated at 17.27 BST6h ago16.07It may take years to hold perpetrators of war crimes in Ukraine accountable, the European Union’s top justice official told Reuters, but those responsible should know the threat of prosecution will hang over them “forever”.The European justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, spoke as the United States and more than 40 other countries work to align evidence to help prosecution and trials for atrocities Russian troops committed in Ukraine.“It will be for the next weeks, next months, next years, maybe for the next decades. For some cases, it will be very fast. It will be longer for others,” said Reynders.“But it is also a clear message to the Russian authorities – the risk of these investigations and prosecutions and trials will hang over them for the rest of their lives. It’s forever.”Reynders said Russia’s war in Ukraine marked the first time the international community started working to bring those guilty of war crimes to justice even before the conflict ended.Updated at 16.55 BST6h ago15.43Turkey will freeze Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership bids if the Nordic countries do not keep promises on counter-terrorism made last month, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said on Monday, adding he believed Sweden was “not showing a good image” for now.Finland and Sweden applied for membership of the defence alliance in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but were met with opposition from Turkey, which accused the Nordic countries of supporting groups it deems terrorists.The three countries signed an accord at the Nato summit in Madrid last month to lift Ankara’s veto in exchange for pledges on counter-terrorism and arms exports. Turkey has said it will closely monitor the implementation of the accord to ratify their membership bids, Reuters said.Updated at 16.52 BST7h ago15.23Ukraine’s foreign ministry accused Russia on Monday of treating Ukrainian prisoners of war illegally and using them for political purposes, and demanded humane treatment of captured foreigners fighting for Ukraine.It urged Russia to adhere strictly to the provisions of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva conventions that define international legal standards for humanitarian treatment, Reuters reported.It said “all foreign citizens and stateless persons” fighting for Ukraine on Ukrainian territory had been voluntarily accepted for military service, and that international humanitarian law should apply to them.Updated at 15.26 BSTNewestNewestPrevious1 of 4NextOldestOldestTopicsUkraineUkraine war liveRussiaEuropeReuse this content",
  "For three years beginning in 2014, the photographer Tamara Merino made a study of the people still living in quilombos, hinterland settlements in Brazil originally formed in the 18th and 19th centuries by people who had escaped slavery. Most of the families in these communities are direct descendants of those people. Before abolition in the country in 1888, more slaves were trafficked from Africa to Brazil – about 5.8 million – than to any other nation. It is estimated that 16 million Brazilians are quilombolas. They were granted rights to appeal for land titles in 1988, but the process has been painfully slow and politically fraught.In the time she spent in these communities, Merino identified a particular spirit among the people she photographed, what she calls “a deep emotional state of nostalgia and a profound melancholy” expressed in the Portuguese word saudade. “This constant feeling of saudade is actually a poetic way to describe missing one’s homeland,” she says in her introduction to her pictures, now on display at the Bronx Documentary Center in New York as part of the Latin American Foto festival. “It is the very same engine that kept their people alive for so many centuries, during sadness and torture… It has been transmitted almost as if it were genetic, generation after generation, into the present day.”Part of that ritualised longing is kept alive in the Candomblé religion, which many quilombo residents practise. The tradition blends African Yoruba beliefs with Catholicism and spiritualism. Maria Carmozina, in this photograph, is the priest at a quilombo religious house dedicated to the goddess Yemanjá, associated with the moon and water in Yoruba culture, the protector of women, translated in Brazil to something closer to “Our Lady of Navigators”, granting safety from storms and floods.

  "A dormant black hole nine times the mass of the Sun has been found outside the Milky Way for the first time, in what researchers have called a “very exciting discovery”.Though it is not the first contender, a researcher from the University of Sheffield says this black hole is “the first to be unambiguously detected outside our galaxy”.The researchers had been looking for black hole binary systems for more than two years before finding what has become known as VFTS243.Paul Crowther, professor of astrophysics at the university, described it as a “very exciting discovery” that arrives after “a number of dormant black hole candidates have been proposed”.Black hole that was closest yet found does not exist, say scientists in U-turnRead moreStellar-mass black holes are formed when massive stars reach the end of their lives and collapse under their own gravity. In a system of two stars revolving around each other, this process leaves behind a black hole in orbit with a luminous companion star.The newly discovered dormant black hole is at least nine times the mass of the Earth’s Sun, and orbits a hot blue star weighing 25 times as much as the Sun.It has been observed in a neighbouring galaxy by a team of international scientists; their study – published in Nature Astronomy – suggests that the star that gave rise to VFTS243 vanished without any sign of an associated supernova explosion.As part of the international research team, Crowther has been working with Tomer Shenar from the Institute of Physics and Astronomy, who started the study at KU Leuven in Belgium and is now a Marie-Curie fellow at Amsterdam University in the Netherlands.Confirming the likelihood of what he termed a “direct-collapse scenario”, ie, a collapse without an explosion, Shenar believes this has “enormous implications for the origin of black hole mergers in the cosmos”.A black hole is considered dormant if it does not emit high levels of X-ray radiation, which is how such black holes are typically detected. Dormant black holes are hard to spot as they do not interact much with their surroundings.VFTS 243 was found using six years of observations of the Tarantula Nebula by the fibre large array multi element spectrograph instrument on the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope.",
  "Being told her baby, Lesedi, was born without the HIV virus was “probably the happiest news I’ve heard”, says Neo Goitsemang, a street vendor. “The relief, from the guilt and fear, was unmatched.”Lesedi, from Selebi-Phikwe, a mining town in the east of Botswana, was born just months after her 35-year-old mother learned she was HIV positive. “What frightened me the most was the idea of ruining my baby’s life before she was even born, by passing the virus on to her.”According to the World Health Organization, Goitsemang had a 15% to 45% chance of passing the virus on to her daughter.Very few babies now born in Selebi-Phikwe to women with the virus are HIV positive thanks to a national campaign to stop mother-to-child transmissions in a country that once had the highest HIV prevalence rate in the world.In 1999, the government launched its Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) programme. Pregnant women are encouraged to get tested and are immediately put on antiretroviral therapy (ART) if they are HIV positive. Their babies are given ART for up to six weeks after birth. Women who are negative are retested during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.More than two decades on, Botswana, which still has a high adult HIV prevalence rate of 20% – with most of the cases among women – is on its way to becoming the first African country to eliminate mother-to-child transmissions.Transmission rates have fallen from 40% in 1999 to below 1% last year, which the WHO called a “groundbreaking achievement”. Seven health districts recorded no transmissions in 2021.HIV testing among pregnant women has risen across the country from 49% in 2002 to 98% in 2021, while the number of pregnant women on ART increased from 27% in 2002 to 98% last year.In December, Botswana became the first high-burden country to receive the WHO’s silver tier award for its efforts to cut child transmission rates.“There is no doubt that the country is on the right path,” says Christopher Nyanga, of Botswana’s health ministry.In Central District, the country’s largest, where Selebi-Phikwe is located, just four babies have tested positive so far this year – less than 1% of the total births and down from 3% in 2019.Dr Kaite Mashini, from the district’s health team, said the achievement was thanks to a community education programme – including house calls to encourage pregnant women to register with local health authorities – free HIV testing and free treatment.“When a newborn baby tests HIV negative, we’re very much part of this victory against the virus. We celebrate the news with the mother, and are celebrated by the community for the role we do,” Mashini says.“It is painful for a mother to deliver an HIV-positive child. It is a burden that she would want to avoid, and it’s a blessing to be able to help save them from it.”Arone Masilo, the district’s HIV counsellor, says most of the women who test positive adhere to treatment, “which makes our job easy as health workers”.“Those who do refuse are very few, and it’s either because they can’t accept their own status as HIV-carriers, or lack trust in government awareness campaigns.”Catherine Mpagase, 38, from Selebi-Phikwe, struggled to accept the news that she had contracted the virus and health workers had to persuade her to enrol on to the programme. “I’m so grateful I listened and so relieved my eight-year-old was born HIV negative,” she says. “She is healthy and stigma-free. She has a bright life ahead of her.”Africa steps up fight against HIV with trial of new combination vaccinesRead moreGoitsemang thinks more awareness is needed. “There is still stigma attached to people living with HIV and this has the potential to discourage expectant mothers from enrolling for PMTCT despite the obvious benefits,” she says.With the government hoping for an Aids-free generation by 2030 – a UN sustainable development goal – Nyanga said more community education is planned. Spending on the programme – 30m pula (£2m) this year – is to increase, and more medicines and skilled personnel will be available for the last push, he says.“As a heavily HIV-burdened country, it will take some time for Botswana to completely eliminate mother-to-child transmission. However, the country is certainly on the right path.”This article was published in collaboration with Egab.Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:Sign up for Her Stage – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email",
  "Rachel Whiteread, artistIn 1990, when I was in my late 20s, I made a sculpture called Ghost: a plaster casting of a Victorian living room. Next I thought: “I’d love to make an entire house.” It seemed like a crazy idea. It would cost thousands – and who would fund it? Then James Lingwood came to have a cup of tea at my studio. He had just taken over running the arts organisation Artangel, alongside Michael Morris, and was in a very upbeat mood. “Is there anything you’d like to do?” he asked, so I mentioned the house idea. He said yes straight away.The one we found, at 193 Grove Road in east London, wasn’t empty: a guy called Sydney Gale was living there with his daughter. He was a wonderful character. Bow council had been trying to get him out for years, but he didn’t want to be rehoused in a high-rise flat. Eventually, they found him another Victorian house, I think. He was bemused by the idea, but interested. He had been a DIY fanatic in the 1970s and had spent a lot of time doing up the house: he’d installed a bar, hung different wallpaper on every wall, that sort of thing.We had to make sure it didn’t get broken into. A poor security guy basically had to live there for monthsIn terms of making, House wasn’t a complex idea. The mould – the house itself – already existed, so the job was really to make a building within that building. We made a new foundation, removed the internal fittings, took the roof off, created a metal armature to support the new structure – and then filled the house with concrete. The complex thing was finding the right material to spray on the walls so that the concrete wouldn’t stick when we tried to remove them. It was messy and exhausting – and the whole thing took months. We began in August 1993 and didn’t finish until late October. The other hard thing was making sure that it didn’t get broken into. A poor security guy basically had to live there for months.House felt autobiographical: I’d grown up in a house in north London that was very similar. But it also had this connection to everyone’s lives. There was a political aspect to it, too. We were coming out of a recession and there were so many debates about housing and the cost of living. Not dissimilar to now, really.The lease the council gave us was temporary, so I always assumed that House would be demolished. Charles Saatchi offered to put it on wheels and transfer it to his gallery. But I didn’t want that. This was its location and this was where it should stay. There was nothing nice about it coming down, though. It was traumatic. But I’ve kept it with me in the work I make now. And I’m proud that so many people have memories of it.‘It was messy and exhausting’ … Whiteread making a concrete cast inside the original house. Photograph: Nicholas Turpin/The Independent/ Rex/ShutterstockJames Lingwood, co-director, ArtangelWe really had to go round the houses to find House. Rachel had some parameters: she wanted to make this piece in London, because that’s where she was brought up. She also wanted it to be in the north or north-east because that was the part of the city she knew best. Then we needed to find a house that was scheduled for demolition. And ideally we needed somewhere that could be seen from all four sides. As it happens, the place we ended up working with was part of a terrace, but most of the terrace had already been demolished. It was the right one.We got lucky with the first people we approached on the council: they were open to the idea. There were antagonists, too, but actually that’s what happened everywhere. House became a lightning conductor for all these different currents: housing was a pressing issue, then as now, so some people immediately asked why we were spending all this money on turning a house into a sculpture instead of keeping it as a home. Public art always makes waves. But we were surprised how divisive it became: there were press stories, opinion columns, debates on TV, everything. The media painted it as a battle between locals and artists, but actually even on the same street there were different opinions. Some people hated it; others it really touched.We had always conceived of House as temporary, but so many people came to see it that we tried to extend the lease. At first, the council voted against it. But the vote was the very same day Rachel was awarded the Turner prize, on 23 November 1993, so there was an outcry. They gave it a little more time, but only until January. Then it went.Did I want it to stay? I always felt that the whole thing was a memorial to the idea of memory, and memory is elusive. So I felt it would be more resonant if it was temporary. It looked so otherworldly – this pale grey, mute form. Over time it would have attracted graffiti and looked more derelict. And memorials tend to disappear into their surroundings. I’m not sure we would still be talking about it nearly 30 years on if it had stayed.That said, when I pass the site, I think of it still being there. Technically it is, I suppose: it’s rubble beneath the grass. But everyone who saw it has their own image, even some people who didn’t. That’s one of the most beautiful things.",
  "A Los Angeles judge privately told lawyers he would renege on a promise and imprison Roman Polanski for sexually abusing a 13-year-old girl in 1977, a former prosecutor testified, setting the stage for the renowned director to flee the US as a fugitive.A previously sealed transcript obtained by the Associated Press late on Sunday of testimony by the retired deputy district attorney Roger Gunson supports Polanski’s claim that he fled on the eve of sentencing in 1978 because he didn’t think he was getting a fair deal.Gunson said during closed-door testimony in 2010 that the judge had broken a promise to let Polanski go free after state prison officials had determined he shouldn’t serve hard time.“The judge had promised him on two occasions … something that he reneged on,” Gunson said. “So it wasn’t surprising to me that, when he was told he was going to be sent off to state prison … that he could not or would not trust the judge.”Roman Polanski rape case testimony can be unsealed, LA prosecutor saysRead morePolanski’s victim testified before a grand jury that during a photo shoot at Jack Nicholson’s house in March 1977, when the actor wasn’t home, Polanski gave her champagne and part of a sedative, then forced her to have sex. The girl said she didn’t fight him because she was afraid of him but her mother later called police.When the girl refused to testify in court, Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in exchange for prosecutors dropping drug, rape and sodomy charges. She has since called for an end to case.The defense lawyer Harland Braun said on Friday – in expectation of the transcript’s release – that the development would renew his effort to have Polanski sentenced in absentia, which would end his status as a fugitive from justice.Braun has unsuccessfully tried that before with prosecutors asserting and judges agreeing that Polanski needs to show up in Los Angeles superior court to resolve the matter.Release of the transcript, which was ordered by a California appeals court on Wednesday after the Los Angeles district attorney, George Gascón, dropped longstanding objections his predecessors made to its release, may support Polanski’s claims that he was going to be railroaded by a corrupt judge.The legal saga has played on both sides of the Atlantic as a recurring scene over four decades of a life marred by tragedy and also triumph.As a child, Polanski escaped the Krakow ghetto during the Holocaust. His wife, Sharon Tate, was among the seven people murdered in 1969 by followers of Charles Manson.Polanski, 88, who was nominated for Oscars for 1974’s Chinatown and 1979’s Tess, won the best director statuette for The Pianist in 2003. But he wasn’t able to accept it because he faces arrest in the US.France, Switzerland and Poland rejected bids to extradite him back to the US and he continues to be feted in Europe, winning praise and working with major actors. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, however, expelled him from its membership in 2018 after the #MeToo movement spurred a reckoning about sexual misconduct.Polanski has argued that there was judicial misconduct in his case. In 2010, a Los Angeles court took sealed testimony from Gunson about his recollections of promises made to the director by the judge in 1977.Polanski’s lawyers, who were in the room during Gunson’s testimony but couldn’t use it in court, have long sought to unseal that transcript to help their case.Judge Laurence Rittenband, now deceased, had been swayed by publicity in the case and changed his mind several times about the punishment Polanski should face, Braun said.After a report by probation officials that Polanski should serve no time behind bars, Rittenband sent the director to state prison for a 90-day diagnostic evaluation to help determine what punishment he should face.The judge said that as long as Polanski received a favorable report from the prison, he would serve no additional time, Gunson said. After six weeks of evaluation in prison, Polanski was released with a recommendation he only serve probation, Braun said.But Rittenband thought the probation and prison reports were superficial and a “whitewash”, said Gunson, who agreed they downplayed or misstated Polanski’s crimes.The judge privately told Gunson and Polanski’s lawyer that he had to be tougher because of criticism in the news media.He said he would send Polanski to prison for a longer term but would then get him released within 120 days, which was possible under sentencing rules at the time.“Roman says, ‘How can I trust the judge that’s lied twice?’ So he takes off to Europe,” Braun said.Gunson acknowledged during his testimony that the judge had discretion to sentence Polanski up to 50 years because there had been no agreed-upon sentence. But Gunson objected to the “sham” proceedings the judge was orchestrating and felt he had broken promises to Polanski.The victim, Samantha Geimer, has long advocated that the case be dismissed or that Polanski be sentenced in absentia. She went so far as as to travel from her home in Hawaii to Los Angeles five years ago to urge a judge to end “a 40-year sentence which has been imposed on the victim of a crime as well as the perpetrator.”“I implore you to consider taking action to finally bring this matter to a close as an act of mercy to myself and my family,” Geimer said.Geimer went public years ago and wrote a memoir titled The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski. The cover features a photo shot by Polanski.Polanski agreed to pay Geimer over $600,000 to settle a lawsuit in 1993.Geimer, who has pressed for investigation of judicial misconduct, asked that the transcript be unsealed and in a letter last month and urged the DA’s office to take a fresh look at the case.Prosecutors have consistently objected to releasing the material but relented earlier this week to honor Geimer’s wishes and be transparent with the public.“This case has been described by the courts as ‘one of the longest-running sagas in California criminal justice history’,” Gascón said in a statement. “For years, this office has fought the release of information that the victim and public have a right to know.“However, the DA did not indicate that Polanski would be able to avoid a court appearance. The news release said Polanski remained a fugitive and should surrender to the court for sentencing. ",
  "Desperate efforts in Italy to prevent the fall of Mario Draghi’s government are only the latest political firestorm in Europe tied to Vladimir Putin’s tests of the west’s powers of endurance. Draghi’s foreign minister, Luigi di Maio, suggested it will be Putin who celebrated the fall of another western government if Draghi does not survive a confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday. “A boat without a rudder goes adrift,” said Ferruccio Resta, the president of the Conference of Italian University Rectors – a metaphor that could apply, to Putin’s satisfaction, to much of Europe as governments come under growing pressure over the perceived domestic cost of the war in Ukraine.The narrative of a brewing popular revolt against western sanctions on Russia certainly fits well with Putin’s central narrative that time and economics are on his side since the sanctions are damaging European consumers more than Russia’s.He feels soaring fuel prices are the most lethal of macroeconomic shocks for politicians as they drive inflation while slowing economic growth.As yet it is premature to take a definitive view about the scale of the potential electoral backlash in Europe, and Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs spokesperson, for instance, angrily complained that rising prices were being attributed to EU sanctions without any evidence. Borrell said of the critics of EU sanctions: “Don’t they have eyes? Do they not look at the graphs? Do they not consider figures or facts?”In France, Emmanuel Macron has been weakened if not muted by the loss of his parliamentary majority to parties more naturally sympathetic to Putin. In Spain, the Socialists, facing elections next year, have just lost their power base in Andalusia, the most populous region. The centre-right People’s party achieved a new record high of 36.3 % in the latest GAD3 poll, its best result since April 2017. If repeated in an election it would be its best result since 2011.In Estonia, the fiercely anti-Putin prime minister, Kaja Kallas, survived last week after her previous coalition government fell in a dispute linked to the country’s inflation rate of 19%, the highest in the 19-nation eurozone. Electricity prices in Estonia are at a record high, averaging €300 per megawatt-hour last week.Kallas skilfully reconstructed her government, but at some cost to the Estonian budget and her credibility. If the economy has not improved by the time of legislative elections next March, she could be in trouble. In Warsaw, the PiS frets about electoral defeat next autumn, even if the opposition would remain supportive of Ukraine. In Bulgaria, a pro-western government has fallen. And, of course, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just been let down spectacularly by the self-inflicted demise of Boris Johnson in Britain.The politician who has fared best at the ballot box most recently is probably Viktor Orbán, Putin’s greatest ally in Europe. Orbán is glorying in it. He said at first he believed European politicians had only “shot themselves in the foot”, but now it is clear that it was a shot to the lungs of the European economy, which is struggling for air everywhere.It may be about to get worse – much worse. On Wednesday, apart from the issue for Italy of Draghi’s survival, the EU will have to decide whether it can agree on a solidarity mechanism if Russian gas supplies run out this winter.Putin’s intentions on that front will become clear on Thursday when the Russian monopoly gas supplier Gazprom will decide whether to resume supplies to Europe after the annual scheduled maintenance break on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The signs are ominous. Gazprom has already said in a private letter to gas customers that it cannot guarantee gas supplies and declared force majeure.Reliance on Russian gas varies greatly throughout EuropeGerman politicians are not disguising from the electorate the scale of the threat, part of an effort to ensure they understand that Putin is culpable. The German economics minister, Robert Habeck, described Putin’s tactics as an attack on Germany capable of causing a catastrophe.Klaus Müller, Germany’s energy regulator, said gas prices for consumers may triple by 2023. He said it was “absolutely realistic” that customers who currently pay €1,500 a year for gas would be asked to pay €4,500 and more in the future. Thomas Matussek, a former German ambassador to London, told the BBC on Monday: “If push comes to shove, we are probably entering the biggest economic crisis that Germany has experienced since the end of the second world war.”Despite the current heatwave, Matussek was right to say winter is already coming, and the critical issue will be the level of European gas reserves going into that winter. Putin’s optimum leverage will come from keeping Germany, still dependent on Russia for a third of its gas going into winter, on the shortest of leashes. Unlike when previous routine maintenance was being carried out, Gazprom did not ramp up gas supplies through Ukraine’s pipelines this time, so Russian gas exports to Europe are currently about a quarter of normal. A titanic struggle between Germany and Russia may loom.By contrast, some countries are better protected. Italy, for instance, has filled far more than 65% of its gas storage capacity and is on track to achieve its target of reaching storage levels of 90% in October, Roberto Cingolani, the ecological transition minister, said at the weekend.Russia’s gas supply routes to EuropeRussia has stopped gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and the Netherlands, and constrained supplies to eight others. Spain’s Enagas has said Spaniards have nothing to fear from a Russian cutoff since it can access gas from elsewhere.Here lies the risk for Russia. It can go for broke in trying to make the EU’s resolve crumble this winter by turning the power off in as many European countries as possible. But Putin will have only one shot at this, and if he fails and Europe’s reserves are big enough to survive to next summer, the west will be on the brink of breaking free from its dependence on Russian gas. Putin will have permanently blown up Russia’s chief source of income and largest gas export market.Fiona Hill, a former US assistant state secretary, argues that there are electoral risks in this for Moscow, especially in 2024 when Putin seeks to extend his term. She says Putin “wants to get this conflict over with. He wants to seem legitimate. He wants us to be the ones who feel that we don’t have time – when he also has a clock ticking.”",
  "Wearing a shirt bearing his granddaughter’s name and a button with her face, Vincent Salazar arrived at the Uvalde civic center around noon Sunday to learn what a Texas legislative committee had determined about the day she died.He didn’t expect answers to his most pressing questions, like exactly how it happened and who was accountable for not preventing the tragedy, but still wanted to be there for Layla, the 10-year-old girl who loved to swim and run and dance before the day a gunman walked into her fourth grade classroom in May.How Uvalde killer’s family and officials missed red flags before massacreRead more“I feel like this every day,” the mourning Salazar said. “Every single day. The report doesn’t change anything.”The committee had prepared a 77-page report that detailed failure after failure from the authorities during the 24 May attack. All morning on Sunday, relatives trickled in to the small south Texas city to pick up their copy.Among those conclusions: red flags about the gunman prior to the attack went unreported or ignored by friends and family. Doors that should have been locked were unlocked. Poor wifi kept some teachers from getting emergency alerts. Officers from multiple agencies failed to confront the gunman for 73 minutes.Relatives of victims, like Salazar, say they can’t trust the findings of investigations done behind closed doors.The committee’s chairman, state representative and Lubbock Republican Dustin Burrows, said the report was a small step forward, a shared set of facts. There will be more reports after the deadliest school shooting in the state’s history.“There were multiple systemic failures,” Burrows said Sunday, adding that other state house committees could do more to investigate who is to blame for some of those failures.“That is not what we were tasked with in this report,” he said.That lack of accountability and trust in the authorities in the town of around 16,000 people, made Salazar skeptical.“I’ll tell you right now, it’s not the truth,” Salazar said. “It’s a joke. Texas failed those children,” he said.While a steady stream of families came to pick up copies of the report, others from all over Texas visited the makeshift memorial outside Robb elementary school.After two months in the heat of a brutal Texas summer, the memorial outside has started to change.The fur on the teddy bears has become matted and gray. After weeks of 100F heat, the dozens of prayer candles have melted. Hundreds of bouquets stacked on top of each other have wilted, giving a scent of dried rose petal in the dusty schoolyard.Layers of toys, letters, hand-drawn posters and other mementos are stacked nearly 4ft high in front of a row of 21 white crosses informally marking the killings of the 19 young children and two teachers.Individual victims have their own references.The pile for Annabelle Rodriguez, 10, has a pale straw cowboy hat and a plush lamb. The one for Alithia Ramirez, 10, has a kangaroo and pink plastic flowers. That for Layla Salazar, 10, has a faded bear dressed as a bee, a pony now with matted fur and a Barbie doll half-buried under dozens of dried-up flowers. Other visible reminders of the massacre are still everywhere in town.Just past the city limits, a sign with the phrase “Uvalde Strong” is right next to a billboard for a local gun shop. The father and step-mother of Uziyah Sergio Garcia, a 10-year-old who died at the school, live in San Angelo, Texas, and were in town on Sunday to see a mural honoring him.When they heard about the newly-released report, they drove to the civic center. Crystal Garcia, Uziyah’s step-mother, hoped it would provide some kind of clarity into what happened that day.“I hope it does, I hope it does,” Garcia told the Guardian. “It’s difficult, not having the answers you want, the answers you need.”Uziyah’s great-aunt, Grace Valencia, pulled out her phone and began to flip through photos of the young boy, saying they’d been due to go on holiday together to a popular waterpark that weekend.At a press conference on Sunday evening, many families wanted to know why the reports authors had not laid blame. They wanted accountability. They wanted action.But because the committee prioritized questions from the media, none of the community members at the meeting were able to ask their questions. When the committee’s press liaison ended the meeting, the room erupted in shouts and jeers.“You kept us waiting, just like you kept those kids waiting, and you’re not going to answer our questions?” shouted Tina Quintanilla-Taylor, whose daughter survived the shooting.“Bunch of cowards!” Daniel Meyers, a local pastor, yelled as the committee left the civic center. “The people have a right to ask questions.”Paul Ruiz, an educator in San Antonio, said that the way the massacre has been handled is part of a long history of delegitimizing Hispanic people in this part of Texas. He pointed to lynchings and segregation efforts in the 20th century, and said continued inequities in the region are key to understanding the tragedy.He also criticized the committee for not recommending any action on gun control in the state. “These cabrones can identify the height of the fence, but they never point to the militaristic weapon that killed 21 people,” Ruiz said, using an expletive. “This is systemic to Texas.”Among those family members with questions was Jesse Rizo, whose brother was related to Jackie Cazares, nine, who died at the school.“She knew me as her tío, her uncle,” Rizo said. “It’s disheartening. These families, they’re looking for closure. It’s just going to drag on.”Even with his low expectations, Salazar said he was upset after reading it with how little the committee did to provide accountability for the massacre that killed his granddaughter.“It didn’t tell you nothing. This whole thing is a joke,” Salazar said. “It’s not good enough for me. It’s not good enough for my granddaughter.”",
  "There are few who have been stalwarts of Sri Lankan politics in the last half-century quite like the man often referred to as “the fox”.Ranil Wickremesinghe, who gained his nickname for his apparently wily ability to repeatedly resurrect his political career, has been prime minister six times since he first entered politics in 1977, though he has famously never completed a term.A lawyer by profession, his first ascension to the role of PM came in 1993 after the assassination of the then president Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was killed in a bomb attack by Tamil separatist militants during Sri Lanka’s three decades-long civil war. But, in what would become a running theme during his career, his term did not last long.Over his various terms in office, both as prime minister and opposition leader, Wickremesinghe became known for being economically capable and a pro-western reformer, particularly for his role steering the country out of a recession in 2001. Yet despite his insistence that he was a “clean” politician, he was not untouched by corruption allegations, and was accused in being involved in an insider trading scam at the central bank. He always maintained his innocence.After he became prime minister in 2015, Wickremesinghe was also accused of protecting the Rajapaksa family – who were political opponents but with whom he had close personal ties – from facing prosecution over alleged corruption and human rights abuses. While investigations were initiated against the family, they ultimately came to nothing.By the time Wickremesinghe had resigned as prime minister in 2019, there was mass public disenchantment with him, in part as a result of his role in government dysfunction that was seen to have enabled the 2019 Easter terrorism attacks.He lost his seat in the 2020 parliamentary elections and had to enter parliament through a list system, the sole parliamentary representative for his once powerful United National party.But it was in May this year that Wickremesinghe was brought back in from political near-obsolescence to be Sri Lanka’s caretaker president, as the country grappled through its worst economic crisis since independence.He took on the post at the special request of embattled president and longtime friend Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was facing an ongoing political crisis including mass protests demanding he resign.In the space of just a few weeks, Rajapaksa had been forced to dissolve his cabinet twice and after his older brother Mahinda, who was prime minister, resigned, the president was desperately looking for a replacement after opposition leaders rejected the post.Wickremesinghe was pitched to the public as a capable, experienced pair of hands, who could help the country navigate this severe financial crisis and negotiate with international organisations including the International Monetary Fund. But among protesters who had been calling for president Rajapaksa to go, Wickremesinghe’s decision to accept the role was seen as a betrayal of the people’s movement, and he was instead accused of propping up and protecting the Rajapaksa family as he had done for decades.As resentment towards president Rajapaksa grew over recent weeks, anger began to be directed at Wickremesinghe too. Calls began to mount for him to resign, and on the night of 8 July when protesters stormed the presidential palace and offices, the prime minister’s official residence was also occupied and Wickremesinghe’s private home burned to the ground. On 13 July, just as president Rajapaksa was due to step down, protesters then occupied Wickremesinghe’s official offices to make clear they also wanted him out.Since president Rajapaksa stepped down on Friday, the rallying cry of protesters has turned to “Ranil go home” after he temporarily took over the role . Yet news that Wickremesinghe intends to formally stand in this week’s secret ballot in parliament, when MPs will vote for the new president, has been met with rage by many on the streets, who do not see him as the change they have spent many months fighting for. His chances of election are high, as he has the backing of the Rajapaksa’s ruling party, who still have the most seats.Yet many fear there will be further unrest on the streets if he becomes Sri Lanka’s next president. “Ranil Wickremesinghe should also step down because he came in defence of this corrupt system and he has failed five times before as prime minister,” said Father Jeevantha Peiris, a Catholic priest who has been a protest leader. “As citizens we don’t accept him, we don’t need another corrupt leader.”",
  "Early on in Gabrielle Zevin’s Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, one of the trio of lead characters gives a fictional interview to a very real video games publication. The troubled but passionate Samson Mazur tells the interviewer, “There is no more intimate act than play, even sex.” This is an explosive statement, but a perfect one in the context of a novel that treasures the act of play and holds it sacred. In some ways, this is a thesis statement for Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow itself: the novel opening its heart, and showing you what it is truly about.Video games are seldom treated in literature as a site of emotion, but in Zevin’s work they are the very landscape that the full spectrum of relationships, grief, and love play out in. The world of video games is a surprisingly uncommon location for the modern commercial or literary novel, despite the fact that they have long since evolved from children’s toy or tech curio into a form of entertainment that is so mainstream as to be ordinary.Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin review – when game boy meets game girlRead moreIn Stephen Sexton’s award-winning poetry collection, If All the World and Love Were Young, the structure is a direct reflection of the narrative and physical journey through the Super Nintendo System classic, Super Mario World. Each piece in the work is named after, and directly in conversation with, a level in the game. The emotional core of the work is that it is an elegy for his mother: as we read the poems, we are at once situated in the strange, pixelated world of the game, on Yoshi’s Island, in Donut Plains: but crucially, we are also in Sexton’s childhood, in front of his television, in the landscape of his youth. The discussion of video game terms such as “infinite lives” becomes richer and deeper when we take that language and place it back into our own navigation of loss. This requires readers to allow a technical video game term to become poetic, to transfer meaning and to develop depth.Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow also engages with this dissonance: in video games, death is simply part of play. When you die, you start again. As metaphors go, this very standard video game mechanism becomes deeply confronting.Video games are much younger than books, and we are only at the beginning of what they might becomeGabrielle ZevinVideo games are much younger than books, and we are only at the beginning of what they might becomeWhen asked about what she thought of where video games and literature are in relation to each other as mediums, Zevin said, “video games are an incredibly young form – obviously, much younger than books, and we are only at the beginning of what they might become”.She’s right: the relative newness of video games in comparison to the novel is what truly separates them, making their intersections all the more special, and rare. The earliest video games emerged in the 1950s, long before the black and white home consoles that brought Pong into living rooms in the 1970s. From that single compelling screen all the way up to the psychedelic, shallow touch of Candy Crush, or the rolling and emotive landscapes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, or the delicate artistry and literary merit of Disco Elysium, video games have come an extraordiary distance both technologically and artistically in the 50 years since Pong. In contrast, the first Greek and Latin texts that could be considered prose novels come from the first century. Fifty years is a dot, a pixel, in comparison with the history of the book.Arguably video games have far more in common with cinema, when it comes to their growth as an art form: around 50 years after the birth of the moving image in 1895, in 1941, audiences were met with Citizen Kane. As far back as 2017, the Hollywood Reporter noted that the video games industry was earning nearly three times as much as the film industry.We now see video games intersecting with television and cinema more regularly, but still, literature and poetry are on the other side of a chasm. The writers who bridge this, such as Zevin and Sexton, are forging an important path. Ernest Cline’s popular but hugely divisive Ready Player One certainly did make inroads across this gap in 2011, but Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow takes a more humane and elegant path through video game culture than the quite literal and dated feel of Cline’s book. Tomorrow is a work about people who play games to survive, and who make games to live: it does not use the language of video games as set dressing. Rather, the world of video games and video game development is just the landscape in which life plays out. This work doesn’t punish you for not knowing who Solid Snake is, or never having played a farming simulator. Tomorrow is about love, above all things, and if you miss a reference, you won’t feel it.The history of gaming here is fascinating and the nostalgia is stunningBea CarvalhoWaterstones’ head of fiction, Bea Carvalho, notes Tomorrow’s approachability: “The history of gaming here is fascinating and the nostalgia is stunning: it will be an instant classic for any gaming fan, and will surely encourage many readers to dust off old consoles. But Zevin’s talent is such that prior fandom is by no means a prerequisite, as she uses the art form as a prism through which to understand the era’s political and technological landscape and to explore identity, grief, mental health, success and failure, among many other topics.”By no means are Sexton, Zevin and Cline’s works the only books about video games, or the only works of art in which video games are central to the emotional arc. Alan Butler’s On Exactitude in Science, shown at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in 2017, presented Godfrey Reggio’s Koyaanisqatsi in a cinematic diptych with his own mirroring work: a frame-by-frame recreation of Reggio’s original shot inside the world of Grand Theft Auto 5. Further back still in 1979, long before Charlie Brooker’s Bandersnatch brought the interactive story to modern homes via Netflix, Lynn Hershman Leeson’s installation Lorna invited viewers to participate in an interactive narrative using a remote control, television and laser disc system to choose their way through a harrowing story about agoraphobia.In nonfiction, Boss Fight Books have been publishing slim, considered volumes of personal essays and close studies of games since 2013, and are arguably en route to becoming a Rough Trade Books of the medium. Each Boss Fight Book focuses closely on a single video game, and the author’s perspective on it, as well as the history of the work, from Earthbound to Goldeneye, closely reading not only the game but often the life of the writer the game touched, too.Video games have been flickering at the edges of other art forms for almost as long as they have existed, and watching them become the heart of novels such as Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is hopeful. Games are an intimate experience, as is the experience of reading literature and witnessing art – and this intimacy is what can connect them, and draw them closer together. Their pasts may be misaligned, but their tomorrow is full of promise. Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin is published by Chatto & Windus.

  "As temperatures hit record highs in Houston, Texas, recently, Robert Bullard, considered the father of the environmental justice movement, saw a pattern. Hospitalizations from heat stroke and health outcomes such as asthma from living next to noxious facilities in the city’s Black neighborhoods have the same root cause.“It’s brutal. What you’re looking at is another example of the climate and health impacts that will all fall disproportionately on our most vulnerable communities,” Bullard says. “We’re talking about the same environmental justice communities that historically have borne tremendous equity impacts from power plants, refineries, oil and gas facilities.”A distinguished professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University and longtime activist, Bullard has written 18 books, including the landmark 1990 Dumping in Dixie, which documented how toxic waste sites and other facilities were disproportionately located in predominantly Black neighborhoods throughout the southern United States.Bullard, a member of the White House environmental justice advisory council, says the US supreme court’s recent curtailing of federal authority over carbon emissions reductions at power plants “can be placed in that same arc of decisions that are basically taking away rights and not protecting the public” as supreme court decisions that are dismantling civil rights’ victories.What does the supreme court’s decision to rollback federal authority on regulating power plants mean for Black, brown, and indigenous communities?It sends a dangerous signal that the federal [EPA], which is the chief enforcement department in the country, has little or no authority to use science, data and facts to protect the public. It leaves it to the political whims of who is elected to a specific office.When you start extending that whole idea that this whole regulatory authority is being unraveled, it’s like pulling a string on a coat. It provides unequal protection and uneven enforcement and uneven burdens on already overburdened communities, communities that have contributed the least to climate change. We are talking about even worse impacts on those frontline communities that are flooding and getting damaged by dangerous storms, droughts, wildfires and smoke. …That’s the unfairness of this court decision, not taking into account the cascading effect this will have on communities already overburdened with pollution and climate change.The supreme court decision centered on what power the US government has to address climate change. Do you see parallels between the decision and the increasing natural disasters, heat waves and winter storms?It’s all connected. When you talk about having a plan to address these issues, when you talk about heat waves, or you talk about hurricanes, or you talk about flooding, you talk about drought, the communities that are hit the hardest are the communities that have the least amount of resources to bounce back.When money comes down for disaster recovery, too often, the money doesn’t follow the need. When the money goes to the state, the state tends to distribute monies in a way, historically, that will leave behind the most vulnerable, the hardest hit and communities of color. That kind of framework allows for the same kind of unequal treatment and equal treatment when it comes to the supreme court not allowing the EPA to regulate Co2 or emissions from power plants.Texas is a textbook case for not having a federal policy that applies to all states. In the absence of that, you will have this patchwork. That applies to not just climate, not just greenhouse gases, but also voting and allowing states to gerrymander, suppress the vote – to do all the things that at one point, when we had a strong Civil Rights Act, would not be allowed to happen.The same forces that are trying to turn back the clock when it comes to civil rights are the same forces that are dismantling environmental protections. You start looking at the court decisions and the practices at the state levels and you can see how it’s basically moving away from protection of public health, away from science, away from facts and away from participatory democracy and public health.Historically, how has the federal government been able to tackle the disproportionate impact pollution has on communities of color?When we look at the EPA, it was founded in 1970. All these many decades, it has attempted to address this unevenness and unequal protection. But it has not eradicated the fact that some communities have the wrong complexion for protection. Some communities are seen as sacrifice zones. They don’t have the political power, organizations and lawyers that can force dollars, resources, infrastructure to protect certain communities. We still have communities that are overpolluted and underprotected.A lot of it has roots in systemic structural racism. When we talk about how the federal government can use its authority on enforcing equal protection, not allowing industries to just keep piling pollution, and not using federal dollars to allow states to discriminate. It’s against the law, but it still happens. We have to fight for more stringent enforcement, equal enforcement of our environmental laws, our housing laws, our transportation laws and our energy laws. All of it revolves around health – the health of the environment and healthy people.When you get a court decision that basically says EPA doesn’t have that authority, it’s almost like saying: if the federal government doesn’t have the authority, then who does? We know that all states are not created equal. That’s the way the real world operates. America is segregated, and so is pollution.For those trying to make changes in their own communities, what’s left to do after this supreme court decision?We have to work on multiple issues. We don’t separate this court decision from trying to suppress the right to vote. We have to work on voting. We have to get our residents access to healthcare. Our groups are not just working on air pollution. Our groups are working on survival issues. We have to work on getting investments in our communities like the bipartisan infrastructure law. We have to work 24/7 to ensure that those dollars get into the communities that are most at risk when it comes to flooding, when it comes to legacy pollutants like SuperFund sites, when it comes to transportation. We have to talk about water systems and water infrastructure that’s falling apart.At the same time, we have to fight to get individuals elected to the school board, the city council, the county commissioner, the state legislature and the Congress and president. This is the kind of strategy we have to continue to move forward in light of these bad decisions. We can’t just throw up our hands and say, ‘Oh, it’s hopeless.’ We have to persevere.",
  "Hundreds of teachers have pledged not to take their students to a new exhibition at the Science Museum in London until it cancels its sponsorship deal with a company linked to the coalminer Adani.More than 400 teachers and educators have so far signed an open letter to the museum warning that it faces a widespread boycott over a deal with Adani Green Energy, whose parent company, Adani Group, is a major operator of coalmines and coal-fired power stations.Ian McDermott, of Harris Westminster Sixth Form in London, said: “I’ve brought many thousands of students to this place over the last 25 years. It makes me so sad that this magical building, that has done so much to benefit and inspire young people, is now actively harming them by allowing coal giants like Adani, who are destroying the future of the world’s young people by expanding mining, to greenwash their reputation at the expense of the reputation of the museum.”Meryl Batchelder, of Corbridge middle school in Northumberland, said: ‘Through environmental education young people are becoming increasingly aware of the damage caused by the fossil fuel industry. As a teacher I try to lead by example and live my life as sustainably as possible. The Science Museum is hugely influential, so it would be an incredible step in the right direction if they became a leader in promoting decarbonisation and turned their backs on Adani and their ilk.”Adani Green Energy is due to sponsor the museum’s Energy Revolution gallery, which will open next year.The museum’s director, Ian Blatchford, said: “We agree that climate change is the most urgent challenge facing humanity but we don’t agree with the argument from some who say we should sever ties with all energy companies with an association, direct or indirect, with fossil fuels. We believe the right approach is to engage and challenge companies and other partners to do more to make the global economy less carbon intensive.”Last October a former director of the museum, Prof Chris Rapley, a climate scientist, resigned from its advisory board over oil and gas company sponsorship.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTA month later 40 prominent figures including a former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and several leading scientists, many of whom have worked closely with the museum in the past, said they were “deeply concerned” about its fossil fuel sponsorship deals and announced they were severing ties with the museum until a moratorium was announced.Two prominent scientists have refused to allow their work to be included in the Science Museum’s collection because of the institution’s links to Shell. And in December Indigenous leaders urged the Science Museum to cancel the Adani Green Energy deal.",

  "At 67, Joyce Faulkner thought she was looking for a holiday. Her husband, Jim, had recently died and exploring possible house swaps on the Home Exchange website felt soothing. In the end, it was not a vacation Faulkner found but a job. She left her home in South Queensferry, just outside Edinburgh, to become mother’s help to seven-year-old twins in the northern Italian town of Varese. Now she is known as “La Babysitter” or simply “La Joyce.”“Really, when I think of it, it’s halfway crazy,” she says. “I came on the strength of two emails.” A house swap she was interested in didn’t work out, but the owner, Rachele, asked: “‘Do you know anyone who might help me with the children?’ I wrote back and said: ‘Tell me what that involves!’ She wrote me a little list, and I said: ‘I could do that!’ She seemed to trust me and I trusted her.”Two months later, Faulkner was on her way to Bergamo airport. The area had been at the heart of Italy’s Covid outbreak. When Faulkner arrived in November 2020, the first Italian word she learned was “tamponi” – swabs – as she queued for her Covid test.When she reached the square in Varese, “the dad, Andrea, was walking towards me with the children hiding behind his legs, kind of shy, thinking: ‘Who is this woman in a long black coat?’ I don’t think it was quite Mary Poppins, but the atmosphere was immediately warm and friendly.”You have to take the opportunity when it presents itselfEighteen months on, Faulkner’s job no longer feels like a job. “I just feel like part of the family.” They joke: “You think you’re going back to Scotland? No, you’re staying here!” She gives English lessons, helps with the housework, meets the children from school, plays chess or table tennis with them, and takes them to the park. “It never feels like work,” she says. “It has been absolutely the perfect match.”Faulkner’s son, Steven, who lives in London, has visited her and they have cycled around the northern Italian lakes. She feels no more distant than when she lived in South Queensferry.Before she made her move, her sister reasonably pointed out: “‘You’re used to living on your own. How are you going to cope?’ I said: ‘Well, if it doesn’t work out, I’ll make another decision.”Even the sight of army trucks taking bodies away from the hospital in nearby Bergamo during the early stage of the pandemic didn’t put her off. “You have to take the opportunity when it presents itself.”Faulkner says she learned this philosophy from Jim. When they met at a teachers’ conference (they both taught English), they had each previously been married.“I fell in love with Jim the minute I saw him, the minute I spoke to him,” Faulkner says. “But I was a bit hesitant. He said: ‘Supposing we only get six months out of this relationship? That’s six months worth having.’ I thought: ‘What a great attitude to life. Not ‘what a waste of six months’, but six months to value and appreciate. We were together from 1983 to 2019.”Thirty-six years, then.“Gosh, as much as that?” she says. “So there you go.”A new start after 60: ‘I risked my house to launch a chain of 24-hour gyms’Read moreIn a funny way, it was Jim who led Faulkner to Italy, because after he died, “almost by mistake”, she arranged five holidays on Home Exchange. “I accepted people’s invitations, and I was to go to Reykjavik, Krakow, Barcelona, Rome, Paris.” Mostly these were places she had been with Jim. “I think I was planning in my head, without consciously doing it, a kind of farewell tour.” Covid intervened. “It made me stop and take stock,” she says.Faulkner is not yet ready to leave Italy. “I haven’t started on an exit plan,” she says. “I’ll be 70 next January. That looks like a big number when you write it down, but in my head, I’m 30. You think: ‘Really? Seventy? How can that be? I still feel the same person, I still have the same enthusiasm for life, the same interest in people and things. In that sense, I wish I had another 70.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60? ",
  "Meteorologists have warned of a “heat apocalypse” in western France as more than 8,500 further people fled their homes to escape a large wildfire sparked by a searing southern European heatwave that has already caused hundreds of deaths.Nearly 25,000 people have been forced to abandon homes, holiday rentals and campsites for emergency shelters in the Gironde département west of Bordeaux, while blazes in Spain, Portugal and Greece have forced thousands more to flee.Temperatures across southern Europe showed some sign of abating on Monday as the heatwave, during which temperatures have surpassed 40C (104F) across much of the region, moved north, including towards Britain, which was set for its hottest day on record.Deadly wildfires blaze across thousands of hectares in Europe“It never stops,” said David Brunner, one of 1,500 firefighters battling to control the Gironde blaze, which since Tuesday has destroyed 14,000 hectares of pine forest near the Dune du Pilat, Europe’s highest sand dune and a summer tourism hotspot. “In 30 years of firefighting I have never seen a fire like this.”An area 5.5 miles long (9km) and 5 miles wide was still burning near the dune on Monday, with temperatures in the area forecast to hit 44C.A forest fire near Louchats in Gironde. ‘It never stops,’ one firefighter said of the region’s wildfire. Photograph: Thibaud Moritz/AFP/Getty Images“We’re climate change refugees,” Théo Dayan, 26, told Le Monde after fleeing his home near the village of La Teste-de-Buch. Jean-Luc Gleyze, the head of the local fire service, said: “We’re not reaching out and touching global heating – it’s hitting us full in the face.” France’s interior ministry announced it would send an extra three firefighting planes, 200 firefighters and more trucks. “In some south-western areas it will be a heat apocalypse,” the meteorologist François Gourand told Agence France-Presse.Wildfires in FranceFifteen départements have been placed on the highest state of alert for extreme temperatures, including Brittany, where the coastal city of Brest was set to hit 40C on Monday, nearly twice its usual average for July.The extreme temperatures of the past week have directly claimed at least four lives in Spain and fanned dozens of wildfires – many still burning – that have seared almost 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) across the country.01:08People in north-west Spain join fight to put out wildfires – videoAs fires continued to burn in Zamora province, video footage shot on a train from Madrid to Galicia on Monday morning showed the service at a temporary standstill as flames and smoke rose from trees on either side of the carriage.“Moments of panic on the Madrid-Ferrol train near Zamora-Sanabria, 9.30am,” Francisco Seoane Pérez, a journalism lecturer, wrote on Twitter. “The train carried on after stopping for a few minutes.”00:27Spain heatwave: passengers stuck on train surrounded by wildfires – videoSpain’s national rail company, Renfe, said no passengers had been in danger at any time.Also on Monday, the regional government of Castilla y León said the body of a 69-year-old man, reported to have been a shepherd, had been found in a burnt-out area near the small town of Escober de Tábara in Zamora.The previous day, authorities in the region also confirmed the death of a firefighter, Daniel Gullón Vara, who died fighting the flames in the same province. A 50-year-old man died from heatstroke on Sunday in Torrejón de Ardoz, near Madrid.A 60-year-old street sweeper died after developing heatstroke while working in Madrid on Friday afternoon, prompting the city council to announce flexible working hours to allow municipal employees to avoid the hottest periods of the day.Wildfires in SpainIn the south of the country, more than 3,200 people fled fires in the Mijas hills, not far from Málaga, though some were able to return later. Spain’s Carlos III public health institute said 510 deaths were attributable to the heat between Sunday 10 July and Saturday 16 July - 150 of whom died on Saturday alone.During a visit to the south-western region of Extremadura on Monday morning, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, paid tribute to Gullón Vara and said the events of the previous week were further evidence of the climate crisis.“I want to make something very clear,” he said. “Climate change kills: it kills people, as we’ve seen; it also kills our ecosystem, our biodiversity, and it also destroys the things we as a society hold dear – our houses, our businesses, our livestock.”Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez (centre), visits an area affected by a forest fire in Puerto de Miravete, western Spain. Photograph: Ballesteros/EPAThe heatwave in Spain, with highs of 45C and record-breaking temperatures across many parts of the country, is forecast to end on Monday.In neighbouring Portugal – where temperatures hit 47C last week – the fires have been brought under control after destroying 12,000-15,000 hectares of land, killing two people and injuring 60 others.Temperatures dropped over the weekend, but the risk of wildfires remained very high, according to the Portuguese Institute of Meteorology (IPMA). More than 1,000 firefighters, backed by 285 vehicles and 14 aircraft, were battling nine ongoing wildfires, mainly in the country’s northern regions, authorities said.As the hot air mass pushes north, Belgium and Germany are among the countries expecting the heatwave to hit them in coming days. Britain may also be on course for its hottest day on record.The government issued a red extreme heat warning for the first time, while trains were cancelled, some schools closed early and ministers urged the public to stay at home.“We hoped we wouldn’t get to this situation, but for the first time ever we are forecasting greater than 40C in the UK,” said Nikos Christidis at the Met Office. The country’s previous high, 38.7C, was recorded in Cambridge in 2019.After a report concluded that weather catastrophes triggered by the climate crisis had cost Germany at least €80bn (£68bn) since 2018, Germany’s environment minister, Steffi Lemke, said the “horrifying” data showed the “enormous damage” of the climate crisis.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe report, published on Monday and commissioned by the economy and environment ministries, estimated that the financial impact of drought, floods and extreme heat in Germany between 2000 and 2021 was nearly €145bn, most of it in recent years.“The numbers sound the alarm for more prevention when it comes to the climate,” Lemke said. “We have got to and will invest more in climate protection and adaptation to protect our people.”Heatwaves are happening more often, are more severe, and are lasting longer because of human-induced climate change. The world has warmed by about 1.1C since the start of the industrial era and temperatures will keep rising unless carbon emissions fall sharply.",
  "When Jacqui Haynes was a child, she had a habit of bringing strays back to the family flat in Ladbroke Grove, west London. Once she found a guy on the road who had taken drugs and was visibly distressed and paranoid. Haynes told him her mother would look after him.“My mum would say ‘you can’t bring everyone home who has a problem, Jacqui,’” says Haynes, now 53. “‘They will rob my house!’”Haynes says she’s been that way her whole life: “If anyone needs advice or support, I’m the know-it-all. I think I was born that way. I’m quite good at it.”Haynes, who still lives in Ladbroke Grove, now runs breakfast clubs and free lunches at St Peter’s Church in Paddington. It all began when she was at church in 2005. “Lots of people were coming in for help,” she says, “and there was no one to help them. I thought, ‘I could do this.’”She started by offering a Saturday lunch service. She says: “From that we got to know people, and realised there were a lot in food poverty. There is very little provision here. We’re at the poor end of Maida Vale. There are a lot of hostels for people with mental health problems. It’s a dumping ground for people who are on the fringes of society.”Every Wednesday, Haynes provides a full English breakfast for the 50-strong group. On Saturdays, it’s a three-course lunch. I believe what you give you will get back tenfoldJacqui Haynes“I do homemade soup, a cooked dinner with meat and two veg, and pudding for afters,” she says. On Thursdays, she offers a food bag with items people can take home and cook. But if people are homeless or can’t cook, she’ll make them ready-meals and sandwiches. She adds: “My whole life is surrounded by food. In north Paddington, people put me in their phone book as ‘Jacqui dinner lady’.”Demand has only increased. When universal credit was introduced I had to buy two extra fridges to cope with demand,” Haynes says.When the pandemic began, she had to purchase an extra freezer because “we needed more supplies. Some people were frightened to come out of the house, so we had to make extra deliveries.”She is concerned about the rising cost of living. “Food is getting so expensive,” says Haynes. “People are paying £7 a day just for gas on their meters. And that’s going to go up when it gets cold.”On average, Haynes feeds about 50 people a day, but she expects to see that rise come winter.Haynes’s private shopping experience, with daughter, at Karen Millen in London. Photograph: Alicia Canter/the GuardianPeople are sometimes so ashamed, they ask to collect food from the back door. “I know how that feels,” Haynes says. “The first time I thought of claiming benefits, when I had my daughter, I walked into the benefits office, started to cry, and walked back out.” She reassures people that there is no shame in using a food bank: “When they get in, they say, ‘It’s not so bad. It’s OK. It doesn’t feel like you’re begging.’ Some people stand in the queue and have a laugh and a chat. But some people are vulnerable, and just want to get their food and go.”Everything Haynes does, she does for free, on her own time. “I believe what you give you’ll get back tenfold,” she says. In addition to her work at the food bank, she operates a support service in North Kensington, offering people help with legal issues, advocacy and school appeals, and she is heavily involved in the post-Grenfell Tower recovery effort.“Everyone thinks I’m stupid,” she says, “because I have no income. I work full-time on these projects for nothing.”Her Christian faith is a big motivator: “I have faith in God and community and humanity, and that will get me through, as long as I fight for what is right.”“She works nonstop,” says fellow volunteer Wayne Llewellyn. “It’s continuous. Literally, seven days a week, nine-to-five. She’s always on the go.”The people making a difference: the public health champion who met his hero, Simon CowellRead moreWhen asked about her treat, Haynes tells me money is always tight. She’s going to a wedding soon and doesn’t have anything to wear, saying: “It’s been a big weight on my mind.”Karen Millen invites Haynes into its flagship store. She takes her daughter and a friend along, and they make a day of it, drinking champagne and trying on outfits. She leaves, thrilled, with three complimentary outfits: a blue trouser suit, a blue and white dress, and a black and white jumpsuit.“I had an amazing time,” she says. “I never get to spend time like that with my close friends and my daughter. Plus, I love my clothes, and that’s a part of me that was lost when I had children. I didn’t know how much I needed that day until I had it. It was good for the soul, and good for the spirit.”Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel? Email us – with their permission – and suggest a treat at guardian.angel@theguardian.com",
  "I have walked around decaying cyberpunk cities such as these many times before, with their omnipresent neon signage and filthy streets, their grimy verticality. Usually I am expected to shoot someone. But this time, I’m slinking around the fluorescent-lit slums of the future as a skinny wee ginger cat, scaling rusty pipes, squeezing through barely-open windows and pattering across corrugated-iron roofs. The robots who have lived here on their own for untold decades have never seen anything like me before, but still, they feel compelled to pet me when I rub up against their spindly metal legs. I am a wild, mysterious, perfect thing in a broken world.Stray is an excellent example of how a change of perspective can enliven a fictional setting to which we’ve become habituated. Post-apocalyptic narratives have been done to death lately, but this one feels interesting because we experience it from such an unusual point of view. Accompanied by a drone, which acts as a translator between the robots, the cat and the player, we make our way through a city sealed off from the world, trying to make it to the outside, where we belong. Stray sounds like a shallow meme – it’s the cyberpunk cat game! – but the setting and the story have substance, and at the end I honestly found it quite moving. Perhaps the least credible aspect of the whole setup is that a cat would actually be so helpful.I had little trouble with any of Stray’s puzzles or challenges, but that might be because I grew up on a combination of 3D platformers and point-and-click adventures in the 1990s, and Stray is a blend of those two genres. You find routes up buildings, leap across gaps and sneak carefully past danger, and you also fetch keys, chat (through the drone) to robots and figure out uses for trinkets you come across. You can linger and take time to explore, and I wish I’d done more of that – there aren’t too many secret things to find in each area, but what’s there is worthwhile, unlocking intriguing information about what happened in this long-abandoned place.Stray has obviously been made by cat people. Of course it has. The cat is brilliantly realistic, with her little twitchy ears, her mrrrows and purrs (which vibrate charmingly through the controller), the way she goes from soft stalk to casual lope to trotting run. Near the start of the game she dons a harness and spends the first few minutes flopping around in a state of indignant confusion that will be familiar to anyone who’s ever ill-advisedly tried to put a kitty in a Halloween costume. My eternal subquest while playing Stray was finding cosy little places to curl up for a snooze; such spots are present everywhere, on cushions, in nooks, in bookshelves, on the belly of a prone robot. There’s no point to this, in that the game doesn’t specifically reward you for it. It doesn’t reward you for digging your claws into every tempting piece of fabric you see, either, or for deliberately batting things off shelves with a little probing paw, but I did that, too. I was just enjoying being a cat.The robots are unexpectedly characterful, too, with their emoji-screen faces and impressive animation. This is a stunning-looking game, whether witnessed from the ground or the rooftops – I won’t spoil the cat’s journey, but the developer wrings copious novelty and some impressively creepy moments from this shut-off city in the seven-ish hours it takes to play through. It’s certainly far from twee, with the possible exception of the bucket-lifts that you can ride down from rooftops, paws and ears all poking out over the top – and those are so cute that they’re instantly forgivable.We might literally control the cat in Stray, but figuratively, there’s always a little distance between us and the creature. As players we’re eagerly hoovering up info from the not-people we meet and the places we go, trying to figure out what to do next – but the cat is just doing its thing, being curious, trying to survive. By placing this magnetic yet unknowable creature of nature into a tightly controlled, man-made science-fiction dystopia, Stray highlights something that any cat person already knows: you can never really tame a cat. There’s always something a little wild about them, and they bring that wildness wherever they go.\nStray is out 19 July; £23.99, or included with some PlayStation Plus subscriptions.\n",
  "Anthony Fauci announced on Monday he will have retired by the time Joe Biden’s first term in the White House ends in January 2025, but said his hope of eliminating Covid will likely not have been achieved by then.“If somebody says, ‘You’ll leave when we don’t have Covid any more,’ then I will be 105,” the government’s chief medical adviser, 81, said in a wide-ranging interview with Politico.“I think we’re going to be living with this,” he warned.Fauci, the long-serving head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, confirmed the news in a later interview Monday with CNN.He said: “I have said that for a long time. It is extremely unlikely, in fact, for sure … I am not going to be here beyond January 2025.”US faces extreme heat as Biden’s climate crisis plan stalls – liveRead moreHe has teased retirement before, telling the Independent last month: “I don’t think it’s going to be a very long time from now.”But the Politico interview is the first time that he has put a timescale on it, noting that Biden will be the seventh and final president he has served in almost 40 years as the institute’s director, and more than five decades as an employee.Previously, Fauci, a hero to many but a frequent target of criticism from the right during the height of the pandemic for his advocacy for lockdowns, masks and mandates, harbored hope, if not an expectation, that a virus responsible for the deaths of more than a million Americans could have been conquered by vaccinations and herd immunity.Fast-mutating Covid variants and subvariants, such as BA.5, however, have fuelled a resurgence in infections and hospitalizations, and are showing resistance to existing vaccines. That, Fauci told Politico, means the virus is likely to become endemic.“What we have right now, I think we’re almost at a steady state,” he said.“I think, although I don’t know for sure, [that] over the next cycle or so, we’ll be getting towards a once-a-year boost, like flu.”Fauci said one of his biggest fears was public complacency, and weariness, over the coronavirus. Vaccination take-up rates are falling, along with the wearing of masks, amid a relaxation of official restrictions, and the Biden administration has been consumed with other crises such as inflation, the Ukraine war, gun violence and abortion rights.Meanwhile, the daily case average has risen to 130,000, and experts predict a larger wave to come in the fall.An almost permanent fixture on the nation’s television screens for two years, he has been seen far less in recent months, seemingly relegated to occasional appearances at White House press briefings and infrequent television interviews.“It’s becoming more and more difficult to get people to listen, because even the people who are compliant want this behind them,” Fauci said.“What I try to convince them [of], with my communication method, is we’re not asking you to dramatically alter your lifestyle. We’re not asking you to really interfere with what you do with your life. We’re just asking you to consider some simple, doable mitigation methods.”Health officials are mulling a recommendation for all adults to be eligible for a second booster shot, but politicians in Washington continue to argue over continued funding for vaccines, testing and therapeutics.Fauci said he regrets the politicization of the pandemic, which have included attacks on him during and following the Trump administration, but he is unmoved by a threat from Republicans to “investigate” him if they assume control of the House in November.“[Retirement] has nothing to do with pressures, nothing to do with all of the other nonsense that you hear about, all the barbs, the slings and the arrows. That has no influence on me,” he told CNN.Asked about his legacy, Fauci did not cite Covid, but instead his team’s decades of work on HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes Aids and gained a foothold during the Reagan administration in the 1980s. The disease is manageable with modern medicines, but there is still no vaccine.“I don’t think there is anything else that I, Tony Fauci, can do except leave behind an institution where I have picked the best people in the country, if not the world, who will continue my vision,” he said.",
  "Northern Ireland and Ireland are enjoying what appears to be a €4bn (£3.4bn) boost, with inter-country trade booming in both directions post Brexit, figures reveal.Official government data released in Dublin by the Central Statistics Office showed that imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland increased 23% to €1.9bn between January and May 2022 compared with the same period in 2021.Trade in the other direction, from Ireland to Northern Ireland, rocketed by 42% to €1.9bn in the same comparative periods.The increase in movement of food and live animals from Northern Ireland to Ireland was dramatic, rising €119m to €544m.However, there was a bigger increase in the sale of energy, recorded as “mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials” and likely to refer to North Sea oil and gas.Sales to Ireland doubled in value from €106m to €218m in the first five months of this year compared with the same period in 2021.The rise may partly reflect the increase in energy prices this year but also suggests a change in sources as Europe continues to wean itself off Russian supplies in the wake of the war in Ukraine.The figures also show that imports from Great Britain to the Irish republic have increased, up from €5.2bn in January to May 2021 to €9.3bn in January to May 2022.Trade barriers caused by Brexit had affected exports to Ireland in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, with paperwork causing new challenges.The latest CSO figures suggest exporters in Britain have become accustomed to the new systems.However, the war in Ukraine also appears to be a factor, with the sale of mineral fuels and lubricants to Ireland from Britain almost quadrupling.In January to May 2021, there were €727m in British exports to Ireland in the sector. This rocketed to just over €3bn for the same period in 2022.The Northern Ireland trade data chimes with a report, published on Monday by the trade manufacturing body Make UK, which shows that 63% of Northern Ireland exports go to the EU, more than any other nation or region in the UK.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskBy value, the biggest jump in exports from Ireland to Northern Ireland was in chemicals and related projects, which went up from €267m to €369m.The second highest increase by value was in exports of food and live animals to Northern Ireland – up from €498m in the first five months of 2021 to €648m in the same period in 2022.Northern Ireland’s trade with Ireland has not been impeded by Brexit, unlike the rest of the UK, where exporters face a mountain of paperwork and compliance issues to sell into the EU.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, which is heavily opposed by unionist political parties, EU law on exports is observed enabling an open border with the republic.",

  "Newly-released body camera footage from the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, shows that within moments of arriving at Robb elementary school, some police officers knew they needed to move swiftly to save lives.“Dude, we gotta get in there,” said staff sergeant Eduardo Canales, according to body camera footage released late on Sunday by the small south Texas city, adding: “He’s still shooting. We gotta get in there.”Instead, a growing group of officers from a variety of agencies waited 73 minutes before a federal agent breached the classroom where children and teachers were dying, and killed the young gunman.It was a delay that had almost immediately become public, if not the specifics, and caused outrage, heartbreak and conflicting accounts after the shooting occurred in May, and which a state committee report just released said could have cost lives.The video footage, released by the city Sunday evening, illustrates a chaotic scene, described by the committee’s report. Among the missteps identified: the school district’s police chief, Pete Arrendondo, did not follow his own shooting incident plan that called for him to set up a command center outside where the incident was taking place.Instead, the newly-released footage shows he was inside the hallway trying to find a key to the classroom door that the state committee found was possibly unlocked.“We’re having a problem getting into the fucking room because it’s locked,” he said as more officers arrived.Later, an off-camera voice whose identity has not been confirmed pleads unsuccessfully with the shooter, 18-year-old  Salvador Ramos.“Mr. Ramos, can you hear us? Mr. Ramos?” the unnamed officer says, addressing the shooter. “Please don’t hurt anyone. These are innocent children. Please put your firearm down. We don’t want anyone else hurt.”The camera footage then shows officers from multiple local, state and federal agencies arriving with more and more tactical gear. Several of them repeatedly question the ongoing delay.“What are we doing here?” one asked 20 minutes after officers arrived at the school.“People are gonna ask why we’re taking so long,” another said nearly an hour later.The state committee found “multiple systemic failures” – including red flags about the shooter, unlocked doors and poor alert systems at the school – led to the shooting, but much of the public outcry, including from grieving families, has focused on the law enforcement response.The committee’s report said 376 officers were at the school, but that they took a “lackadaisical” approach when attempting to confront the shooter.“They lost critical momentum by treating the scenario as a ‘barricaded subject’ instead of with the greater urgency attached to an ‘active shooter’ scenario,” according to the report.The report committee’s chairman, state representative and Lubbock Republican Dustin Burrows, said on Sunday: “There were officers in that building who knew or should have known that more should’ve been done.”Burrows also criticized the lack of a clear chain of command at the scene. Besides Arrendondo, acting Uvalde police chief Lt Mariano Pargas was also in the hallway, according to the body camera footage. Both Arrendondo and Pargas have been put on administrative leave.On the footage, a dispatcher is heard telling officers via radio that a child in the “room full of victims” had called 911. An officer tells Pargas, who does not audibly respond.In another video from outside the school a half-hour after the gunman arrived, Uvalde police sergeant Daniel Coronado pulls out a collapsible baton and smashes a school window.“Is anybody in there? Police,” one officer shouts into the broken window. “I want you to come to the window right now. We’re only here to help.”Several officers, including at least one from the US Border Patrol, begin lifting children and teachers out from the window, trying to avoid injury on the broken glass.“It’s OK baby, it’s OK,” Coronado tells the children as they exit and flee. “It’s ok, baby. Run, run, run.”",
  "Ukraine’s president has appointed an experienced security official as acting head of the domestic security agency after a shake-up that has renewed questions over Russian intelligence infiltration of key ministries and suggested divisions within Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s inner circle.After recent anonymous briefings against Zelenskiy’s childhood friend Ivan Bakanov – who had been in charge of the 30,000-strong state security service, the SBU, since 2019 – over claims of failure to counter Russian infiltration, he was abruptly suspended on Sunday along with the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, who had been leading war crimes investigations.Zelenskiy announced on Monday that Bakanov would be replaced by Vasyl Maliuk, a former first deputy head of the SBU who led the anti-corruption and organised crime unit of the agency’s central directorate.While the reason cited for the dismissals was the claim of widespread Russian collaboration in the two departments, it also appears to reflect jostling for influence around the president among key players.Zelenskiy, feted on the world stage as a wartime leader, had been dogged domestically before the invasion by accusations that he had appointed inexperienced outsiders, including friends, to jobs in which they were out of their depth.Zelenskiy recently dismissed ambassadors to five countries including Germany, and several other envoys including those to Hungary, Norway, the Czech Republic and India. And last month, there was a public spat with the head of his armed forces.Bakanov in particular was regarded as close to Zelenskiy, having grown up in the same city of Kryvyi Rih. He worked for Zelenskiy’s Studio Kvartal-95 production company and ran the former actor’s campaign headquarters during his presidential bid. At the time of his appointment, he was accused of holding a leading position in a private company registered in Spain in an apparent breach of Ukraine’s anti-corruption legislation.While observers suggest that one motive is to demonstrate to the Ukrainian public that Zelenskiy will not tolerate underperformance, hostile briefings against key figures have ticked up in recent weeks.Initial reports suggested that the pair had been fired, but Andriy Smyrnov, Zelenskiy’s deputy chief of staff, clarified that they had been suspended. “Everyone has been waiting long enough for more concrete and, perhaps, radical results from the heads of these two bodies to cleanse them of collaborators and traitors,” he said. “However, in the sixth month of the war, we continue to find dozens of such people at each of these institutions.”An article for Politico three weeks ago quoted unnamed senior officials as saying Zelenskiy was planning to replace Bakanov for lack of competence, not least after complaints that his agency was ill-prepared for the Russian invasion, in particular over its failure to destroy a key bridge to Kherson in the south.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe article suggested that Zelenskiy and Bakanov rarely spoke, that the president was fretting about the optics of sacking someone from his inner circle and that SBU daily operations were being run from the presidential office.An official close to Zelenskiy told the website: “We are highly unsatisfied with his job and are working to get rid of him. We are not satisfied with his managerial, you know, [skills], because now you need … anti-crisis management skills like we don’t think that he has.”On 27 June, when asked about Bakanov’s position at a press briefing, Zelenskiy seemed to suggest his job was safe. “As for the head of the security service of Ukraine, if I wanted to fire him, I would have already fired him,” he said.The presidential decree announcing the suspensions of the two officials cited hundreds of criminal proceedings over alleged treason and collaboration by people within their departments and other law enforcement agencies.“In particular, more than 60 employees of the prosecutor’s office and the SBU [state security service] have remained in the occupied territory and work against our state,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address to the nation.“Such an array of crimes against the foundations of the state’s national security, and the links recorded between Ukrainian security forces and Russian special services, raise very serious questions about their respective leaders.”Over the weekend, Oleh Kulinich, a former head of the SBU in Crimea, who was fired in March, was arrested on suspicion of high treason.#Ukraine finally arrested the top ranked mole, long-time Russian FSB agent Oleg Kulinich (linked to sanctioned by the US Andrey Derkach). Since 2020, Kulinich was returned by Ukr top spy Ivan Bakanov to top ranks in @ServiceSsu & responsible for occupied #Crimea.

Admired by western officials and media, she has, however, been a more controversial figure in Ukraine over her department’s failures regarding a number of major anti-corruption cases.On the frontline, Russian shelling in battle-scarred eastern Ukraine left six people dead, Kyiv said on Monday.Rescue workers in blue helmets could be seen digging through debris and clearing rubble from the collapsed remains of a two-storey building in Toretsk that was struck by Russian artillery.Russia also disclosed on Monday that the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, had ordered the military to concentrate on destroying Ukraine’s western-supplied rockets and artillery, which have hit several dozen Russian ammunition stockpiles and command centres since coming into service.EU foreign ministers are convening to discuss strengthening sanctions against Moscow and the bloc’s foreign policy chief warned of the “life and death” consequences of Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea grain exports.However, with officials from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN likely to meet again this week to discuss resuming exports, a Turkish official raised the prospect that lingering “small problems” surrounding a deal could be overcome.",

Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned the constitutional right to abortion.However governor Jim Justice said lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Senate and House of Delegates “are not ready” right now to craft new abortion legislation, the State Journal reported. While the legislature will hold a special session later this month to debate a proposal to slash the state’s income taxes, Justice predicted a special session on legislation to restrict abortion would have to be called later.Updated at 20.27 BST1h ago20.00Richard LuscombeHere’s a little more on the West Virginia abortion ruling. Circuit court judge Tera Salango sided with the state’s last remaining abortion clinic on Monday by overturning a 19th-century law that made performing or receiving the procedure a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.The ruling allows the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia to immediately resume providing abortions, which it stopped following the 24 June US Supreme Court decision overturning federal protections provided by Roe v Wade.The state argued that an abortion ban on the books dating back 150 years, which included an exception when the woman’s life was in danger, was still enforceable.But Salango agreed with the position of the ACLU of West Virginia, which argue for the clinic that the law was invalid, partly because it had not been enforced in more than 50 years, but also because it had been superseded by others, including a 2015 law allowing abortions until 20 weeks.1h ago19.37Judge approves resumption of West Virginia abortionsA West Virginia judge on Monday blocked officials from enforcing a 19th-century ban on abortions after the US supreme court overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade decision that recognized the right of women nationally to terminate pregnancies, Reuters reports.The decision by Kanawha county circuit judge Tera Salango clears the way for the state’s lone abortion clinic to resume services, which it suspended out of fear of prosecution following the high court’s 24 June ruling.We’ll have more details soon...Updated at 20.13 BST2h ago19.34A bipartisan group of congress members has introduced a bill called the Respect for Marriage Act in response to a warning from Justice Clarence Thomas that the right wing Supreme Court majority could soon take aim at same-sex marriage.Thomas, one of six conservatives on the panel, appeared to signal in June that the court would likely follow up its overturning of Roe v Wade abortion protections by looking at other “settled” issues, including the 2015 Obergefell ruling that legalized gay marriage.House judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said Monday that the bipartisan group, which includes Republican Maine senator Susan Collins, was proposing the new act in an attempt to enshrine marriage equality into federal law.Nadler said: Three weeks ago, a conservative majority on the Supreme Court not only repealed Roe v Wade and walked back 50 years of precedent, it signaled that other rights, like the right to same-sex marriage, are next on the chopping block.\nAs this Court may take aim at other fundamental rights, we cannot sit idly by as the hard-earned gains of the Equality movement are systematically eroded. \nIf Justice Thomas’s concurrence teaches anything it’s that we cannot let your guard down or the rights and freedoms that we have come to cherish will vanish into a cloud of radical ideology and dubious legal reasoning. 2h ago19.12Richard LuscombeNancy Pelosi’s office has announced that Olena Zelenska, Ukraine’s first lady and wife of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will address members of both chambers of Congress on Wednesday morning.Olena Zelenska, the First Lady of Ukraine, will speak to Congress on Wednesday. pic.twitter.com/EHnZk5iVgZ— Kyle Stewart (@KyleAlexStewart) July 18, 2022\nThe announcement said she will speak at 11am, but gave no details of the topic.

Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta/APHer comments almost exactly echoed the language of a bill by Republican Kentucky congressman Thomas Massie last year that said: “unelected bureaucrats in Washington DC should not be in charge of our children’s intellectual and moral development.”DeVos, who once advocated for guns to be allowed in schools to counter the threat from grizzly bears, was among several ultra-conservative speakers at the summit of a group set up during the Covid-19 pandemic to fight mask and vaccination mandates in schools.They included Florida Republican senator Rick Scott, who was applauded by attendees for voting against the bipartisan gun reform package signed into law by Joe Biden last month.The conference also featured a breakout panel on school safety including Scott and Ryan Petty, a Florida board of education member whose daughter Alaina was among 17 murdered in a 2018 high school shooting in Parkland, Florida.The panel, the Phoenix reported, discussed arming school personnel and tightening security on campuses, but not gun reforms advocates say might have prevented shootings such as in Parkland and in Uvalde, Texas in May, where a teenage gunman killed 19 students and two teachers.The Moms for Liberty group has a high profile supporter in Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis, whose raft of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in recent months includes the so-called “don’t say gay” bill banning discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms.DeSantis, a likely 2024 presidential candidate whose state education department banned dozens of math textbooks earlier this year for “prohibited topics,” urged attendees to resist what he sees as left-wing wokeism.“Now is not the time to be a shrinking violet. Now is not the time to let them grind you down. You’ve got to stand up and you’ve got to fight,” he said, according to Politico.Updated at 19.14 BST2h ago18.40The president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has defended WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and repeated his offer asylum to him. In June, the UK approved Assange’s extradition to the US to face prosecution for charges involving WikiLeaks’ disclosure of confidential diplomatic cables and military records.At a routine press conference Monday, Reuters reports, Lopez Obrador said: “I left a letter to the president about Assange, explaining that he did not commit any serious crime, did not cause anyone’s death, did not violate any human rights and that he exercised his freedom, and that arresting him would mean a permanent affront to freedom of expression.”Lopez Obrador has called Assange “the best journalist of our time.” Lopez Obrador claims to have penned a similar letter for former President Donald Trump before he left office. Updated at 18.41 BST3h ago18.17Legal fights over abortion access continue across the US. Today in West Virginia, the state’s lone abortion clinic is asking a judge to toss an 150-year-old state law so that the facility can immediately resume providing the procedure. The Women’s Health Center of West Virginia suspended performing abortions on 24 June, when the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. The 1800s West Virginia law states that obtaining or performing an abortion is a felony, which can result in up to 10 years imprisonment, according to The Associated Press. The exception is for instances where a woman or other pregnant person’s life is at risk. The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia has contended that the statute isn’t valid because it hasn’t been enforced in more than five decades, and has been superseded by more contemporary statutes on abortion, which recognize the right to this procedure, AP says. Advocates point to West Virginia’s 2015 abortion law, which permits the procedure up to 20 weeks. The state’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, has contended that the old law remains enforceable.Lawyers for the state contend that the law hasn’t been enforced solely because Roe would have made illegal the prosecution of abortion recipients and providers, per AP.

At the conference, the congresswoman’s husband, Orange ounty Mayor Jerry Demings, told Politico that her voice was hoarse from speaking at several events. Politico notes that it’s not known where Demings contracted Covid-19. Other prominent democrats – including Florida congressman Charlie Crist and Illinois governor JB Pritzker – attended the convention. Politico reports that no other top speakers have publicly disclosed whether they have tested positive for Covid. Demings, who was once considered as a possible vice-president to Joe Biden, attracted national attention when she worked as an impeachment manager during Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial.Updated at 18.38 BST3h ago17.38The day so farIt’s a hot day across much of America, with parts of the country enduring a wave of temperatures that will hit dangerous levels in places, however major action against climate change is still stalled indefinitely in Washington. Meanwhile, more allies of Donald Trump are feeling legal heat related to the 2020 election and the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.Here’s what has happened today so far:\nJody Hice, a Georgia congressman and 2020 election denier, has been subpoenaed by a grand jury looking into attempts to subvert the election results in the state.\nThe trial of Steve Bannon, a former top adviser to Trump, begins today. He’s facing contempt charges for defying the January 6 committee.\nA prominent economist outlined his argument against the relentless pursuit of economic growth in an interview with The New York Times Magazine, arguing it was unsustainable.\n4h ago17.23The Washington Post has published an excellent look at where US emissions are now, and what senator Joe Manchin’s death blow against Biden’s climate agenda means for the fight to stop global temperatures from rising.America’s carbon emissions are already on the downward trajectory from their peak in 2005, the data says, and thus, Manchin’s decision last week not to support provisions to hasten their decline means the US likely won’t hit goals intended to keep global warming in check.From the Post’s report: A major part of the goal can be achieved by riding the ongoing downward trend in emissions, which reflect government policies and actions taken by the private sector, particularly the energy industry, to become more sustainable. For instance, a recent analysis by the Rhodium Group, a research firm that closely tracks emissions policies, found that the United States is already on track to reduce emissions by somewhere between 24 and 35 percent below their 2005 level by 2030.\nBut that’s nowhere near enough to meet the pledge.\nThe current blowup of negotiations with Manchin “makes it harder, and it makes any additional actions by the executive branch that much more critical. The stakes are now that much higher,” said John Larsen, a partner with Rhodium.\nSeveral analyses have suggested that policies like those contained in the Senate legislation could have accounted for about a billion additional tons of annual U.S. emissions reductions.\n“We estimate the Senate budget deal likely would have cut emissions by roughly 800 million to 1 billion metric tons in 2030,” said Princeton University professor Jesse Jenkins, an energy policy expert and modeler.\nIn Jenkins’s analysis, there would still be a gap, albeit a small one – of hundreds of millions of tons – to achieve the Biden administration pledge.\nSomewhat separate from all of this is what it means for the Earth – after all, every major emitter has to act or else each one’s progress, or lack thereof, will be moot.Updated at 18.41 BST4h ago17.09Joan E GreveThe Guardian’s Joan E Greve has taken a look at a question swirling around Joe Biden as he struggles with both his advanced age and record low approval ratings: could he decide not to run again in 2024?Joe Biden is having a rough summer. The US supreme court has overturned Roe v Wade, ending federal protections for abortion access. Although gas prices are now falling, they remain high and have driven inflation to its largest annual increase in more than 40 years. West Virginia senator Joe Manchin has finally ended any hopes that the president had of passing a climate bill in Congress. With an evenly divided Senate, Biden’s options for addressing these problems – or enacting any of his other legislative priorities – are bleak.The American people have taken note. Biden’s approval rating has steadily fallen since April and now sits in the high 30s. A recent Monmouth poll found that only 10% of Americans believe the country is heading in the right direction.

  "Naked yoga.I circled the words in my conference program and flagged them with three question marks. Should I go? What would it be like? Was it a ploy for exhibitionism at the conference I was attending – intended for “sex connoisseurs and sex professionals”?I Googled to learn more, and the top results were pornographic websites. I tried instead “naked yoga New York” and that search brought up studios that offer the practice (thanks, Brooklyn). It’s a niche market, to be sure, but naked yogis point out that unlike other western fads (eg goat yoga), the practice originated centuries ago from Hatha Yoga and Tantric Buddhism.As a sociologist, I had spent the past four years studying debates over internet pornography and I was attending the annual Sex Down South conference to learn how progressive activists, educators and sex workers talked about porn. I wanted to learn about the general culture that surrounds what I describe as the “porn positive” movement – a broad effort to promote the rights and wellbeing of porn performers, embrace sexual expression and oppose censorship.Sex Down South offered a reprieve from the usual social paradigm where white men occupy the center and are surrounded by others on the margins. Instead, this event was led by queer-identified people of color, and white people like me were the definite minority. It seemed that naked yoga fell in line with the other sessions at the conference, like meditation and Reiki, that merged ancient religious traditions with a broad understanding of sexual health and wellbeing.Sitting in my hotel room the night before, I tried to imagine myself in a bare-all downward dog and blushed at the thought. I had been attending yoga classes regularly since my early 20s – but never naked.Still, I was comfortable with my naked body. In my mid-30s, I had overcome the body issues that plagued my younger self. I had years of practice baring my chest in public as I openly breastfed my two babies. I was no swimsuit model – my then three-year-old called my post-partum belly “squashy” with much affection – but was afforded an ease in my skin thanks to my relative proximity to idealized beauty standards (I am white, cisgender, relatively thin, and able-bodied).For years, I practiced yoga as my preferred form of exercise because it was the only time I could fully leave behind what Buddhists call the “monkey mind”, and let my body take over. I preferred heated classes and often left the studio drenched in sweat, feeling like I felt after a long, hard cry. After both, my body and mind felt tired and calm.Off the mat, I understood and agreed with critiques of the American yoga industry, which profits from a religious tradition and culture that is not its own. But on the mat, I let that go, along with my to-do list and worries. Would I be able to do the same unclothed?The room was lit with twinkle lights, a pleasant reprieve from the harsh overhead fluorescents of other conference sessions. As the room filled with other participants, it immediately felt like a different kind of space than both my yoga studio at home and the rest of the conference. There were no tank tops with the Lululemon logo or “spiritual gangster” written on the front, and there were also no sexy jumpsuits or stiletto heels like at the conference’s evening reception the night before.Not knowing anyone else at the conference, I sat cross-legged and silent. Even though the room was cold, the air conditioning not yet tempered by the room full of bodies, I found myself sweating. I was nervous. Am I really going to take my clothes off in front of these people? Illustration: Xiao Mei/The GuardianComing of age as a woman in the United States, I was instilled with very specific messages about my naked body and who should see it. I learned that, post-puberty, my body was inherently sexual, an object that enticed. Indeed, this is the premise (and feminist critique) of much mainstream pornography: in porn, naked women’s bodies are on display for the pleasure of others, not themselves. Outside pornography is no better, though, as women have little power over when and how their bodies are sexualized. In my own life, I opted for some semblance of control by distancing myself from heterosexuality. I stopped dating cisgender men around the same time I took up a yoga practice.To practice yoga naked meant to remove the constraints we impose on our bodies to better access the divine within usThe instructor introduced herself a few minutes after the session was scheduled to begin. She was a robust white woman in her 50s with long grey hair and a soothing cadence to her voice, wearing a sage green linen top and loose matching pants. She explained that to practice yoga naked meant to remove the constraints we impose on our bodies to better access the divine within us. She told us that today’s class would be a yin practice, meaning gentle movements, and that we could move through the postures in whatever state of dress or undress that we felt like.As we began, she asked us to consider how our clothing felt on our bodies and I became forcefully aware of the discomfort of my jeans. She invited us to remove a top layer of clothing and I peeled them off. The sensation of air meeting my thighs was delicious. After more poses and invitations to remove clothing, I stopped fretting about my state of undress and started tuning into the instructor’s prompts to bring awareness to both breath and body.Eventually I peeked beyond my mat and was surprised that everyone around me was naked or nearly so. I hadn’t noticed people taking their clothes off. When we entered tree pose, I was able to fully take in the room. These were not the bodies we see in commercial porn, on magazine covers, or in TV and movies. These were ordinary bodies, of various ages, shades, shapes and sizes. We were beautiful there in that room, all of us awkwardly balancing on our mats.It felt powerful to be naked in a room full of these strangers, with no sexual chargeAmid my research on battles over pornography and my own early experiences showing my naked body to others, it felt powerful – almost cleansing – to be naked in a room full of these strangers, with no sexual charge. Where any pretense was stripped away along with our clothes.After the conference ended a few days later, I returned to my regular life a thousand miles away with a notebook full of handwritten observations relevant to my research. These were important data for the book I would eventually write, but what preoccupied my thoughts as I typed up my field notes were those 45 minutes of naked yoga. It had shifted how I understood what I was doing at the conference in the first place, and broke apart my own assumptions and stereotypes I carried with me, however unintentionally, into my research.I started studying pornography debates after being brought up in a Christian church and developing my career researching conservative evangelicals and sexuality. Religion was the route to this project, and it was everywhere in the anti-porn movement. But I thought I left religion behind when I entered porn positive spaces. Even though, as a sociologist of religion, I knew that the religious left has been advocating for progressive sexual politics for decades, I was still allowing evangelical leaders and politicians to take up all the space when it came to moral claims about pornography.There were some good reasons for these stereotypes. The people I interviewed who were politically conservative and devoutly Christian opposed porn. The people who were politically liberal and not religious tended to be more sympathetic to it. The messaging at events similarly toed the party line. The anti-porn conferences I attended were led by religious conservatives (even non-religious events had evangelical sponsors and spokespersons). Porn positive events were secular and often anti-religious, explicitly condemning the mission of conservative Christian politicians and leaders attempting to regulate sexuality.But this doesn’t mean that the porn positive movement is absent moral and spiritual principles. The sex workers, activists and educators I interviewed produced porn outside commercial studios and advocated for the creation and consumption of what some called “ethical porn”. A common saying was “sex work is work”, meaning that sex workers deserve fair labor practices.But while virtually everyone I interviewed on the porn positive side would agree with this sentiment, so too did they agree that sex work was a special kind of work. Adjectives varied; some called it a service, some called it art, some called it political resistance. And many, explicitly or implicitly, described it as sacred: a kind of work that offers something profound, contemplative, even divine. As one activist, who identifies as Black and Buddhist, told me, the potential of independent pornography is that it can promote the message that “all bodies are worthy of love. I am worthy of love. I am worthy of care. I am worthy of healing.”Stripped down to its core, the porn positive movement I studied bore little resemblance to the glossy, airbrushed images of commercial porn. What I found instead was a profound respect for the body and the work it does: for pleasure, healing, for life itself. Of course, in the world of pornography, this is complicated by the industry’s dark side: the potential for abuse and coercion and the overwhelming presence of harmful stereotypes of women, especially women of color, and other minoritized groups. But it’s not so different from any industry in the business of bodies, yoga included. All must reckon with the influence of capitalism, the priority of profits, and the normalization and idealization of the bodies of some over others.In today’s political debates, we often fall into dichotomies, mutually exclusive and opposite categories of the right versus the left. Pundits describe one side as guided by religion and faith, and the other by science and reason. But these are false dichotomies.Naked yoga is but one example of how both sides in debates over sexual politics see their position as a sacred calling. For me, it was a “religious experience” as much as I have ever known. Our nakedness was a reminder of what we have in common as we navigate how best to live and relate to one another in our shared social world.Kelsy Burke is the author of the forthcoming The Pornography Wars: The Past, Present, and Future of America’s Obscene Obsession",
  "For almost a year-and-a-half, Italy’s politics has been characterised by a highly unusual degree of stability and consensus. During Mario Draghi’s premiership, the country has come through the worst of the Covid pandemic and successfully laid claim to a large tranche of recovery fund money from the EU. Much of the credit for this has rightly gone to the former European Central Bank chief, who was parachuted into the role of prime minister to bring order to chaos, following the ignominious collapse of the previous government.This period of calm, which has been highly popular with voters, was always to be time-limited. Mr Draghi has presided with skill over a broad-based national unity government created to deal with an emergency; but although he is not the first unelected economist to run the country, Italy is a democracy not a technocracy. Normal politics was due to resume via elections next spring. But that timetable now risks being unhelpfully accelerated, following the decision by the Five Star Movement to boycott a confidence vote last week. Mr Draghi promptly resigned, only to be talked out of doing so immediately by President Sergio Mattarella. But depending on the outcome of fraught negotiations, he may decide to go this week.In the context of an economic and geopolitical crisis likely to peak this winter, Mr Draghi’s early departure would be bad news for Italy and for Europe. The fallout from Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine has, in effect, generated a second emergency in the wake of the pandemic. It raises multiple challenges for a country that remains dangerously vulnerable to external shocks. On Monday Mr Draghi was in Algiers urgently seeking alternative energy sources to Russian gas, the supply of which is being weaponised by Vladimir Putin. Italy also needs to roll over €200bn of debt later this year, and the country’s borrowing costs have risen sharply as political instability returns to Rome. This week the European Central Bank is set to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, ratcheting up the pressure.In such treacherous circumstances, Mr Draghi represents a safe pair of hands, and his high reputation in Brussels and with the bond markets constitutes a significant asset for Italy. As Britain undergoes yet more political turmoil, and Emmanuel Macron struggles to impose his political will in France, Mr Draghi’s steadying influence on the European stage is also needed in a period when unity over Ukraine will be severely tested.It is possible that another leader could be appointed to replace him, if he opts to go. But a plausible outcome of an autumn election would be a hard-right government, possibly headed by the leader of the post-fascist Brothers of Italy party, Giorgia Meloni. Ms Meloni’s party, which has stayed outside the national unity coalition, currently tops polls and would pick nationalist fights with Brussels on issues ranging from economic reform to immigration and same-sex marriage. It is hard to think of a more destabilising turn of events at a time of continental crisis.Last weekend, more than 100 mayors joined business and union leaders in calling on Mr Draghi to rethink his decision to resign. They should be listened to. Italy must eventually resolve its political differences at the ballot box. But the election should take place next spring, and Mr Draghi should remain in post for now.",
  "In our new series, Why I Quit, writers, activists and celebrities talk about something they have swept from their lives, for the better – or worseI blame the White Rabbit: “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” Pocket watch in hand, glasses perched on nose, the furry figure’s anxiety reinforced the authority figures in my daily life – parents, teachers – whose control over my tender years convinced me that being late was a crime, a sin, a failing, a fault. The one sure way that a child could incur the wrath of adults. And it could have unpleasant consequences, too: a detention or an outing cancelled. So “hurry, hurry” has always been the mantra driving my way of life, making sure I didn’t miss the train, the curtain-up, the opening speech – life itself.In later years I realised I didn’t have to obey this inner drive. What made the difference? As I ventured cautiously on to the underground in the weeks after a hip operation, I found everyone rushing. What’s more, they were all rushing at exactly the same pace, keeping up a regular rhythm, keen to get there, wherever “there” was. Someone like myself, treading slowly and purposefully, was simply an obstruction. People swerved and pushed past me: irritated, rude, hurrying to their train, hurrying through life. Not me. I am now the person who takes the lift at railway stations, who defers to pushy people elbowing ahead in the shopping queues. I arrive early for trains and flights, just so I don’t have to hurry. I take pleasure in browsing the concourse, surveying the magazine stall, checking the departure schedules. In your own time: how to live for today the philosophical wayRead moreThe Welsh poet WH Davies nailed the problem: “What is this life if, full of care, / We have no time to stand and stare?” Yes, plenty of care and not enough time, that’s the truth.How is it that so many of us load our lives with cares? Is it through choice or necessity? In my case I confess to both: I can scarcely pick up a magazine or watch a television programme without wanting to try out that recipe, visit that seashore, rearrange the furniture. Off I rush to buy those ingredients, book the train and shuffle the cushions. None of this is necessary. So it must be choice. But it doesn’t feel like that. It has to be intrinsic to my nature, not planned, and not needed, but a choice that is somehow responding to some deep-seated drive. Hurry up there, hurry along!As to necessity, well, look around. Urban life is scarcely possible without hurrying to fulfil all that needs to be done. All that washing, dressing, eating, washing up, tidying, cleaning, shopping, gardening, washing – and we haven’t started to earn a living yet. So hurry up! Tumbling into the world, there is all that travelling, arriving, greeting, briefing, ordering, writing, meeting, agreeing, disagreeing (this takes longer). Add on the pleasure element: greeting (different people this time) online, on Twitter, dining, visiting, enjoying, sharing … when will it ever end? Sleep comes as a blessing.Lately I have formulated some rules to limit hurrying. Is it seriously possible to do less of everything? Cut out some things entirely, and do essential things in a more perfunctory way. Who needs to iron clothes or wipe dishes? These are the fetishes of a disciplined childhood. Indeed much of urban life is organised to help you: online shopping, bulk buying, bulk cooking and freezing, drip-dry fabrics, Deliveroo. But this brings me up against an unavoidable truth.Somewhere deep inside I probably enjoy all this hurrying. I even enjoy complaining about it. I suspect that it makes me feel needed, wanted, fulfilled. I could, after all, move to the countryside, and live the simple life of a patch of ground and a few chickens. How unhurried that could be. Following the seasons, watching the stars, measuring each moment in the cycles of nature – buds opening, leaves falling.But wait! Why not plant some vegetables, keep a sheep or two, pick some hedgerow fruit, make some jam. And if I hurry I can catch the one bus a day into the local town, have tea and scones with those new friends and stay on to catch the choir singing in the cathedral.Yes, I’m afraid it’ll be a hurried life wherever I am.\nJoan Bakewell is a broadcaster, writer and Labour peer\n",
  "Pop artist Claes Oldenburg, who turned the mundane into the monumental through his outsized sculptures of a baseball bat, a clothespin and other objects, has died at age 93.Oldenburg died Monday morning in Manhattan, according to his daughter, Maartje Oldenburg. He had been in poor health since falling and breaking his hip a month ago.Claes Oldenburg’s most incredible sculptures – in picturesRead moreThe Swedish-born Oldenburg drew on the sculptor’s eternal interest in form, the dadaist’s breakthrough notion of bringing readymade objects into the realm of art, and the pop artist’s ironic, outlaw fascination with lowbrow culture – by reimagining ordinary items in fantastic contexts.“I want your senses to become very keen to their surroundings,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 1963.“When I am served a plate of food, I see shapes and forms, and I sometimes don’t know whether to eat the food or look at it,” he said. In May 2009, a 1976 Oldenburg sculpture, Typewriter Eraser, sold for a record $2.2m at an auction of postwar and contemporary art in New York.Early in his career, he was a key developer of “soft sculpture” made out of vinyl – another way of transforming ordinary objects – and also helped invent the quintessential 1960s art event the Happening.Saw, Sawing is seen in Tokyo. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesAmong his most famous large sculptures are Clothespin, a 45ft steel clothespin installed near Philadelphia’s City Hall in 1976, and Batcolumn, a 100ft lattice-work steel baseball bat installed the following year in front of a federal office building in Chicago.The placement of those sculptures showed how his monument-sized items – though still provoking much controversy – took their place in front of public and corporate buildings as the establishment ironically championed the once-outsider art.Many of Oldenburg’s later works were produced in collaboration with his second wife, Coosje van Bruggen, a Dutch-born art historian, artist and critic whom he married in 1977. The previous year, she had helped him install his 41ft Trowel I on the grounds of the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, the Netherlands. Van Bruggen died in January 2009.Oldenburg’s first wife, Pat, also an artist, helped him out during their marriage in the 1960s, doing the sewing on his soft sculptures.One of his early large-scale works was Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks, which juxtaposed a large lipstick on tracks resembling those that propel army tanks. The original – with its undertone suggestion to “make love [lipstick] not war [tanks]” – was commissioned by students and faculty and installed at Yale University in 1969.The original version deteriorated and was replaced by a steel, aluminum and fiberglass version in another spot on the Yale campus in 1974.Oldenburg’s 45ft steel Clothespin was installed in 1976 outside Philadelphia’s city hall. It evokes Constantin Brancusi’s 1908 The Kiss, a semi-abstract depiction of a nearly identical man and woman embracing eyeball to eyeball. Clothespin resembles the ordinary household object, but its two halves face each other in the same way as Brancusi’s lovers.Oldenburg was born in 1929 in Stockholm, Sweden, son of a diplomat. But young Claes (pronounced klahs) spent much of his childhood in Chicago, where his father served as Swedish consul general for many years. Oldenburg eventually became a US citizen.As a young man, he studied at Yale and the Art Institute of Chicago and worked for a time at Chicago’s City News Bureau. He settled in New York by the late 1950s, but at times has also lived in France and California.",
  "The condensed nature of the men’s major championship schedule leaves an unsatisfactory pause after the final putts are holed at the Open. To be precise, 263 days will have passed between Cameron Smith holding the Claret Jug aloft at the Old Course and the opening tee shots being struck at the 2023 Masters.There is reason, however, to wonder what on earth the professional game could – or should – look like by the time it returns to Augusta National next year. Mainstream tours can wish away the LIV Series all they like and the R&A can try to divert focus on to Smith’s outstanding final round of 64, but the fact remains this major was dominated by discourse about the rebel league.Cameron Smith is Australia’s newest major champion and golf’s everyman | Matt ClearyRead moreIn no particular order: Tiger Woods rubbished the Saudi Arabia-backed concept. Martin Slumbers, the R&A’s chief executive, made plain that he has little time for it either. Greg Norman and Phil Mickelson were absent from past champions’ events because of their LIV association. Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood took aim at the media. Sergio García did likewise towards the DP World, formerly European, Tour. As Smith was in the midst of a trophy presentation, the former European Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjørn was on social media defending himself against claims made by García. The man currently in the role once held by Bjørn, Henrik Stenson, has been constantly linked with a defection to LIV. So, too, has the former Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama. A deal for Matsuyama could be worth upwards of $300m.When asked directly whether he had LIV in his sights – and there is background talk of an all-Australian team being unveiled – Smith issued a classic non-denial denial. “I just won the British Open and you’re asking about that,” said Smith. “I think that’s pretty not that good.” Pressed on the topic, he added: “I don’t know, mate. My team around me worries about all that stuff. I’m here to win golf tournaments.” It was not exactly categoric.A meeting of the board of the official world golf rankings, convened in St Andrews, discussed LIV’s application to join. History in that domain dictates nothing will happen quickly but it can be guaranteed LIV will turn on golf’s existing ecosystem – including most likely legally – if they believe they are being unfairly shut out. The four majors sit on the seven-man OWGR board.The 2021 Masters winner Hideki Matsuyama has been linked with a defection to LIV. Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty ImagesAny notion all of this will have gone away by the time of the 87th edition of the Masters is best left to those in Cloud Cuckoo Land. Augusta National’s chairman, Fred Ridley, finds himself in an invidious position. Mickelson, García and Patrick Reed are past Masters champions who play on the LIV circuit. The successful prising of Matsuyama, who won at Augusta in 2021, and the Open champion would make it even more difficult for Ridley to distance his tournament from the Saudis. Yet for Augusta and the three other US-based majors, this scenario has potential to be toxic given LIV’s alliance with venues owned by Donald Trump and the increased protest from families of 9/11 victims about what is unfolding on golf courses.Jon Rahm, the world No 5, used media duties on Sunday to suggest golf’s warring factions should sit round a table in a bid to find middle ground. It is difficult to envisage how that can happen. The PGA Tour’s commissioner, Jay Monahan, has flatly refused to engage with LIV from day one. The DP World Tour has increased its alliance to the PGA Tour. García sounds so embittered by all things Europe that he has walked away from the Ryder Cup, once regarded as key to his professional legacy. Norman, not the most popular figure in golf even before he bowed to the Saudi dollar, has few people left at the summit of the game to take public pot shots at. The late Kofi Annan would have struggled with such a fractured scene.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It is abundantly clear that numerous golfers care insufficiently about Saudi’s human rights abuses to ignore LIV’s advances. During last month’s US Open Graeme McDowell complained about a “smear campaign” against him and his LIV chums. Equally depressing, but in purely sporting terms, is that players once immersed in the spirit of competition believe that 54 holes, no cuts and guaranteed cash carries sporting merit. Stenson fits the profile of many LIV players as being past his competitive peak, but it would be a serious blow to the European Ryder Cup scene if a captain can be poached in this manner. Which, in turn, is what makes him hugely appealing to LIV.Discussion with both regular and occasional golf observers during Open week centred nine times out of 10 on golf’s civil war. It is the all-consuming storyline. The end of a major year leaves us all to ponder the landscape come Georgia in April. Augusta National’s LIV position, surely to be declared long before then, should be a source of fascination.",
  "A federal criminal trial got under way on Monday, with the start of jury selection, to determine whether Steve Bannon, the influential former adviser to Donald Trump, broke the law by refusing to comply with a subpoena for documents and testimony by the panel investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol.Last fall, the congressional committee investigating the deadly Capitol riots subpoenaed Bannon to sit for a deposition and to provide a wide range of documents related to the events of January 6. Bannon refused to comply. The committee cited him for contempt and referred him to the US justice department for prosecution in October of last year. Too old to run again? Biden faces questions about his age as crises mountRead moreThe justice department pursued the referral, and a federal grand jury indicted Bannon on two counts of contempt of Congress, both misdemeanors, in November. It is extremely rare for the justice department to pursue such charges – before Bannon, the last contempt prosecution was in 1983. Bannon faces between 30 days and a year in prison if convicted on each charge.Bannon, whom Trump fired from the White House in August of 2017, has emerged as a powerful conservative voice since leaving the White House, and his podcast, War Room, has become a must-stop for those on the political right. He has used it to stoke baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and began outlining how Trump could try to overturn the elections starting in September 2020.Days in advance, Bannon predicted that Trump would declare himself the winner on election night and take advantage of confusion that would result as Democrats picked up votes because of mail-in ballots that were counted after in person votes. Trump wound up doing exactly that.The committee said in its contempt report that Bannon appeared to have “some foreknowledge” of what would happen on 6 January. It has also said that Bannon and Trump spoke twice on 5 January. “All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,” Bannon said on a podcast after the first call. “It’s all converging and now we’re on the point of attack tomorrow.”In the leadup to the attack, Bannon was also was present at the Willard hotel, the nucleus of Trump’s legal efforts to overturn the 2020 election.Bannon is the first former Trump administration official to face a criminal trial for refusing to participate in the January 6 probe. From the moment he was indicted, he has pledged to fight the charges, saying on his podcast recently he was going “medieval” and would “savage his enemies”. But Bannon has suffered a number of defeats in the leadup to the trial as US district court Judge Carl J Nichols, a Trump appointee, has blocked many of Bannon’s main defenses.“What’s the point of going to trial if we don’t have any defenses?” David Schoen, one of Bannon’s lawyers, said at a recent hearing. Nichols replied by simply by saying “agreed”.Nichols’s ruling stripped Bannon of some of his key defenses, including that he had been relying on the advice of his lawyer when he defied the subpoena. Bannon’s lawyers have also claimed that Trump invoked executive privilege to shield Bannon from compliance, but it’s not clear that Trump did so and whether or not a former president has the power to grant such protection to someone not serving in government. The Trump lawyer Justin Clark told Bannon’s attorney in a letter that he didn’t believe Bannon was immune from testimony.After the rulings, the only defenses that appear to remain for Bannon is that he might have somehow misunderstood the deadline to respond to the subpoena, and that he did not think he had defied the subpoena because the select committee told him in a letter after the deadline that they hoped he might still cooperate with the investigation.Bannon has maneuvered to try to delay the trial, citing the publicity of the committee’s public hearings and by recently offering to testify before the panel. Prosecutors argued the move was an attempt to put off the trial. Bannon had also attempted to call prominent Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, as witnesses in his case, but Nichols’s rulings appear to make it more difficult for him to do so.Government prosecutors have said it will take them just a day to put on their case. Bannon’s lawyers have said their defense could take weeks.Federal prosecutors are also pursuing contempt charges against Peter Navarro, another ex-Trump administration official. Like Bannon, Navarro has pleaded not guilty.Hugo Lowell contributed to this report",

  "The Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has called for a windfall profits tax, arguing the idea is a “no-brainer” that has been taken off the table due to the influence of big companies.Stiglitz made the comments to reporters during a tour of Australia after personally lobbying the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, to introduce the tax and warning that excessive interest rate rises could push Europe, the US, and then Australia into recession.At a press conference on Monday the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, again ruled out a windfall profits tax despite a new report from the progressive thinktank Australia Institute finding rising profits are helping to drive inflation.Federal, state and territory ministers meet to tackle Australia’s growing housing affordability crisisRead moreStiglitz said a windfall profits tax was a “no-brainer” as companies made “huge windfall profits” during the Covid pandemic, and as the Russian invasion of Ukraine had increased energy prices.The tax would discourage companies from exercising “monopoly power” and induce them not to increase prices, he argued, and prevent largely foreign-owned resource companies from extracting money from Australia .Stiglitz told reporters the windfall profits tax “seems to be politically difficult for this government”, suggesting companies “have a lot of influence”.In comments to employees of the Australia Institute, Stiglitz also praised environmental taxes such as a carbon tax, which he acknowledged may not be feasible in Australia, an apparent reference to the bipartisan consensus not to drive emissions reduction with taxes since the Coalition’s repeal of the interim carbon price.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, headed by former finance minister Mathias Cormann, has also called on Australia to adopt a carbon price despite Cormann spending years in government fighting against the idea.Later on Monday, Chalmers told reporters he accepted “wages aren’t driving the inflation problem that we have in our economy” but did not anticipate further revenue-raising beyond responsible changes to multinational tax and tax compliance.“We’ve made it clear that a windfall tax is not something that we are considering,” he said.“I had a long conversation with Joe Stiglitz about this this morning in my office. We’ve made our view clear on that for some time.”Jim Chalmers warns of ‘confronting’ inflation and wages forecast in July economic updateRead moreAustralia is currently enjoying unemployment of just 3.5% after a decade of wage stagnation, but with inflation set to reach 7% and interest rates on the rise, employers and the Reserve Bank don’t want wage growth to add to inflation.Stiglitz warned it would be a “mistake” to allow workers’ wages to fall behind the increase in prices because “wages are not really the source of the inflation” in Australia, and falling real wages would “exacerbate” inequality.Given inflation is “focused in a few sectors”, central banks should be careful using monetary policy – a “very blunt instrument” – to deal with the problem, he told reporters in Canberra.Stiglitz said “a primary risk” is unemployment, warning: “If you raise interest rates too much and too fast, there will be, almost surely, an economic downturn.”Australia was “not as likely to tilt into recession” as the US, he said, as it is in a “much more robust” position.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningStiglitz argued the US is “probably already” in a recession, with growth negative in the first quarter of 2022, preliminary data suggesting it will be again in the second quarter, and the fourth quarter of 2021 only positive due to an increase in inventories.“What Australia has to be sensitive to is that there is a significant risk that Europe and the United States will go too far, and there will be a global downturn.”Stiglitz said the lower bound of Australia’s inflation target, 2%, had been “pulled out of thin air” and there was “no theory or evidence that 2% was the right number”.Stiglitz said there is a “strong theory” that during a high period of transformation, “it makes a lot more sense” to accept “a slightly higher rate of inflation if it facilitates that kind of transition”.He warned that high interest rates made it harder for businesses to invest.“We want to do everything we can to ensure that transformation happens rapidly and without a loss of jobs.”",
  "A White House adviser and his partner have called on the United Nations to move a key climate change summit from Egypt due to the country’s treatment of LGBTQ people, citing fears that they and other activists would be targeted by security forces if they attend the talks.The couple, Jerome Foster and Elijah Mckenzie-Jackson, have written to Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to condemn the choice of Egypt as host of the Cop27 talks due to its “LGBTQ+ torture, woman slaughter and civil rights suppression” and that the decision “places our life in danger in the process of advocating for the life of our planet”.Cop27 summit must focus on how world will adapt to climate change, says UN envoyRead moreThousands of delegates from countries around the world, including various heads of state, are set to head to the coastal resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh in November for the Cop27 climate conference. The talks are seen as crucial amid rising concerns about food security and governments’ failure to adequately slash planet-heating emissions.But climate activists have voiced concerns about the ability of protesters, indigenous rights groups and others to access the event. Sameh Shoukry, Egypt’s foreign minister, has said the government will assign “a facility adjacent to the conference centre” to contain activists, with a coalition of human rights groups warning this risks curtailing people’s ability to protest world leaders’ inaction on the climate crisis.Alarm has also been raised over the fate of Alaa Abd El Fattah, who has spent much of the past decade in prison, and is now on hunger strike, over his anti-government protests and comments.Foster, a 20-year-old US activist who is an adviser to the White House on environmental justice issues, said that he worried he could be arrested or imprisoned because of his sexuality if he went to Egypt.“Being gay in Egypt is scary. We aren’t going to put our lives at risk and we don’t want anyone else to have their lives at risk,” he told the Guardian. “It’s terrifying. My family is highly religious and it was really hard to even talk about all this with them, the idea of going to a country with that sort of extra fear is traumatizing.”Mckenzie-Jackson, an 18-year-old British climate activist, said the UNFCCC needed to move the conference or risk failing to uphold its own stated values, which includes a prohibition of any discriminatory behavior against people for their sexual orientation or gender identity at any event held by the body.Download original document“The UN is being irresponsible, it isn’t practicing what it preaches,” he said. “There are better options of countries in Africa that will still include African voices. People shouldn’t be cannon fodder for the climate movement. Cop27 will fail if it’s in Egypt because critical voices will be left out.”While same-sex relationships aren’t explicitly banned in Egypt, the country’s security forces have used laws designed to protect against public “debauchery” to harass, arrest, imprison and even torture LGBTQ people, according to human rights groups. One of the co-signatories to Foster and Mckenzie-Jackson’s letter is Ahmed Alaa, an Egyptian who was imprisoned for three months after waving a rainbow flag at a concert.Rasha Younes, a Middle East and North Africa LGBTQ rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said it is not uncommon for security forces to drag people from the streets solely based on their gender expression or to entrap them through dating apps or social media by pretending to be romantically interested in them, only to then arrest them, throw them in prison and encourage other inmates to abuse them.“The evidence we’ve collected on entrapment suggested a coordinated policy by Egyptian authorities to target LGBT people,” Younes said. “Anyone going to Cop27 should be concerned and should take precautions, particularly with their online activity. But of course we are even more concerned for people who live in Egypt already.“Under [Egyptian president] Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, authorities have waged a persecution against those perceived to be gay or transgender, there have been widespread abuses,” she added. “The problem is systematic and huge. Cop27 provides an opportunity for civil society to pay attention to what’s happening on the ground in Egypt.”The UNFCCC did not respond to a request for comment on its support for LGBTQ people or the demand to move the location of the climate conference.",
  "Germany’s energy crisis has led the coalition government to toy with ideas that have long been seen as politically taboo, such as extending the life of unpopular nuclear power plants and – perhaps even more divisive – imposing a speed limit on the autobahn in the hope it will reduce fuel usage.As the country braces for a winter of uncertainty amid fears that Russian gas could be cut off completely and electricity may be in short supply, the three-way coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business FDP are looking for ways to ease the situation.Central to the debate is also how Germany hopes to maintain its climate goals, particularly after a recent decision – backed by the Green economics minister – to reignite highly polluting coal-fired power plants for a limited time.The proposal gaining ever more traction and making its mark in newspaper editorials and late-night television debates is for the country’s remaining three nuclear power plants, which are due to close at the end of the year, to be kept running, a move staunchly opposed by the Green party since it came into existence in the 1980s.Speed limit signs on the A5 autobahn near Frankfurt. There are calls to impose speed limits on the autobahn to help fight climate change. Photograph: Michael Probst/APMeanwhile, the FDP has not publicly signalled that it is ready to give up its enduring opposition to a speed limit on the autobahns, but the opposition Christian Democrats, under pressure from their close allies, have hinted they may be prepared to consider backing a temporary limit.Germany’s last three remaining nuclear power stations generate enough electricity to heat about 7m homes, or to cover just under 6% of the country’s electricity needs. Talk of keeping them open remains speculative, but comments from both sides of the debate suggest they might move towards a compromise.The Greens’ co-leader, Ricarda Lang, said on Sunday that it was not the right time to think of prolonging the life of the plants, but she said that owing to the energy crisis and the impact it was having on lower-income families, her party had to be ready to consider all options.“At every moment in this crisis we need to react according to the current situation and to examine every measure. That’s what we’ve done in the past … and that’s what we’ll continue to do,” she said on German television.She said the Greens’ main concern was the impact of higher energy bills. “We have to prevent a wave of poverty,” she said.In response, Jens Spahn, a parliamentary deputy of the Christian Democrats, which along with the FDP has long opposed a speed limit, said: “If the Greens said they would let nuclear power run for another half a year, then I believe we should also be ready to talk about the speed limit.” He told Germany’s breakfast TV programme Morgenmagazin that at a time of national emergency, “everyone has to be prepared to jump over their own shadows”.Experts have said the flippant way in which the two issues are being discussed does not reflect the complexities behind them. The two issues are said to be to Germans the equivalent of what gun ownership is to Americans.The phase-out of nuclear power plants in Germany was triggered by the Fukishima accident in Japan in 2011, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to renewed debate.A government report concluded that prolonging their use was not advisable as it would “only make a small contribution to energy security” and would “increase costs elsewhere”. It said the challenge of refuelling them would mean they would not deliver electricity until autumn 2023, and they would have to run between three and five years longer in order to make investments in staff and infrastructure pay off.It also said security measures to protect the plants, including from air attack, meant it was not feasible to consider them as a short-term solution. And all that is before any likely legal challenges are taken into account.Introducing a speed limit on the parts of the motorway that have none would be easier, in theory. Advocates say it would increase safety and reduce emissions. A 130 km/h (80 mph) limit could decrease CO2 emissions by 1.9m tonnes a year, according to the German environment agency.Opponents argue it would not make the roads safer – most deaths occur on country roads, not motorways – and insist the freedom to speed has to be clung to as it is one of the few areas of German life which remain relatively unregulated.FDP voters are among the strongest supporters of no speed limit and keeping nuclear power, while Green voters are almost equally in favour of a speed limit and ditching nuclear power. And just as the Greens argue that a speed limit would reduce emissions, FDP members are liable to argue that keeping open the three nuclear plants would save about 30m tonnes of CO2 annually.ADAC, which represents about 21 million German drivers, has said about 50% of its members are in favour of the introduction of a limit and 45% are against.",
  "A US-based libertarian coalition has spent years pressuring the Canadian government to limit how much Indigenous communities can push back on energy development on their own land, newly reviewed strategy documents reveal.The Atlas Network partnered with an Ottawa-based thinktank – the Macdonald-Laurier Institute (MLI) – which enlisted pro-industry Indigenous representatives in its campaign to provide “a shield against opponents”.Atlas, which has deep ties to conservative politicians and oil and gas producers, claimed success in reports in 2018 and 2020, arguing its partner was able to discourage the Canadian government from supporting a United Nations declaration that would ensure greater involvement by Indigenous communities.The Canadian parliament did eventually pass the legislation to begin implementing the declaration in 2021, but observers say the government has made little progress to move it forward.Meanwhile, Indigenous groups linked to MLI’s campaign – including the Indian Resource Council – continue to appear at conferences, testify to federal committees and get quoted in major media outlets to push the view that Indigenous prosperity is virtually impossible without oil and gas.Floodlight logoHayden King, executive director of a Toronto-based Indigenous public policy thinktank called the Yellowhead Institute, called the campaign “a contemporary expression of the type of imperialism that Indigenous peoples have been dealing with here for many, many years”.MLI directed questions about the reports to the Atlas Network, which did not respond to requests for comment.The Atlas Network calls itself a “worldwide freedom movement” and has nearly 500 partners, including thinktanks like the Manhattan Institute. Other powerful partners include the Cato Institute, a thinktank co-founded by Charles Koch in 1977, as well as the Heritage Foundation, which hosted a keynote speech by Donald Trump in April. Their influence on US politics includes leading campaigns to make Americans doubt if human-caused climate change is real.Atlas members have helped influence the views of Republican politicians, including George W Bush. The Arlington, Virginia-based organization – which received more than $1m from the oil company ExxonMobil through 2012 and $745,000 from foundations linked to the Koch brothers through 2018, according to watchdog groups – has also exerted significant influence on conservative politics in the UK and Latin America.Bob Neubauer, a researcher with a Canadian oil and gas watchdog organization known as the Corporate Mapping Project, said Atlas includes “a very significant number of the most influential rightwing thinktanks and advocacy organizations on the planet”.“It should make people nervous,” he added.Atlas and MLI have for years been pushing back against attempts by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to align Canadian laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), a declaration Canada endorsed more than a decade ago. That could have codified Indigenous rights to reject pipelines or drilling, the Atlas Network feared, according to their strategy documents, which were shared with Floodlight by an investigative climate research organization called DeSmog.That’s because the treaty contains clauses affirming Indigenous peoples’ sovereignty over territories they’ve lived on for thousands of years. Implementing it would potentially make it harder for extraction companies to operate on those territories. At stake, the report explains, were Canada’s “monumental reserves of natural gas, hydro-electricity, potash, uranium, oil, and other natural resources”.In recent years the Atlas Network has deepened its connections to Canada, setting up a Center for US and Canada that “works with local civil society organizations on both sides of the border to create positive perceptions of the role of free enterprise and individual liberty”, according to its website.MLI is one of roughly a dozen Atlas Network partner organizations in Canada. It’s a relatively new organization, formed only in 2010, but its board members and advisors come from some of the top lobbying, legal and financial firms in the country.Justin Trudeau signed a C$1.3bn deal to settle a Blackfoot tribe’s century-old land claim. Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty ImagesIn 2018, the Atlas Network created a 13-page “thinktank impact case study” report about a campaign being led by MLI called the “Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy Project”. Atlas wanted to highlight this project at a training academy for its partners around the world.The report is no longer accessible on the Atlas Network website but was recovered by DeSmog on an internet archive called the Wayback Machine.“The Macdonald-Laurier Institute, its staff, and the authors affiliated with the Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy project were the only entities that worked on that project,” MLI spokesperson Brett Byers wrote in an email.“Questions regarding the content, nature, or interpretation of a report published by the Atlas Network are better directed toward the Atlas Network,” he added. The Atlas Network didn’t respond to a detailed list of questions about its involvement.The report claims that this project was started “at the behest of the Assembly of First Nations”, a national advocacy group for Canada’s Indigenous peoples, which “saw potential in the natural resource economy as a major driver of transformation in Indigenous opportunity”. The Assembly didn’t respond to a media request asking if this is accurate.The Atlas report notes that a prime objective of this collaboration was removing barriers to the production of fossil fuels. It explains that as political momentum began building in 2016 for Canada to implement the UN declaration, this “concerned the team” at MLI.That was because the UN declaration contains a clause stating that Indigenous peoples have the right to give “free, prior and informed consent” before governments make decisions that could have a large material impact on their traditional territories.Some legal experts see this as a reasonable way to ensure that Indigenous communities are equal partners in decision-making. But the MLI and the Atlas Network appeared to interpret this to mean that those communities could effectively veto new oil pipelines, fracking operations and other resource extraction projects. “This provision, while well-intended, would have allowed even the most fringe groups to veto improvement projects at the expense of whole communities,” Atlas argued.“It is difficult to overstate the legal and economic disruptions that may have followed from such a step,” the report continued.MLI with the support of Atlas embarked on “a sophisticated communications and outreach strategy to persuade the government, businesses, and Aboriginal communities on the dangers involved with fully adopting UNDRIP,” the report says.Early success came that November, when then Canadian Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould, who is a member of the We Wai Kai Nation, “offered her support to MLI’s view”. The report was referring to a 2016 speech where she said that fully implementing UNDRIP would be “unworkable”, creating doubt about the government’s commitment.“MLI’s experts are always in regular communication with MPs, Ministers, and government officials,” Byers wrote. Wilson-Raybould didn’t respond to a media request.Meanwhile, an opposition party member introduced a new bill meant to enshrine UNDRIP in law. This effort slowly gained momentum and political support, but when the bill ended up before Canada’s Senate for approval in 2019, an MLI scholar named Dwight Newman submitted written comments that the legislation’s inclusion of “‘free, prior, and informed consent’” could “have enormous implications for Canada”.“The bill was ultimately defeated,” Atlas explains on its website.“There could be some truth to that,” said King, who is Anishinaabe from Beausoleil First Nation. “The bill died in the Senate because Conservative senators delayed and basically filibustered the legislation.” And one of the senators accused of filibustering, Don Plett, quoted at length from a MLI report during a Senate debate about UNDRIP.This was seen as a major victory by Atlas, which appears to have provided funding for the campaign. “Atlas Network supported this initiative with a Poverty & Freedom grant,” notes a 2020 document on the Atlas website. That document also identified First Nations allies “working directly” on the campaign, such as the Indian Resource Council and the First Nations Major Projects Coalition.“That is inaccurate,” wrote a spokesperson for the First Nations Major Projects Coalition, referencing 2018 testimony its vice-chair gave in support of UNDRIP.When the Trudeau government made yet another attempt to implement the UN declaration in 2021, Indian Resource Council president Stephen Buffalo told a standing senate committee that there should be language in the legislation preventing “special-interest groups” from being able to “weaponize” the declaration to block new pipelines.“Whether or not you support the oil and gas industry, it is the right of the 131 nations of the Indian Resource Council of Canada to develop their resources as they see fit,” he said. The organization didn’t respond to a media request.The Trudeau government successfully passed a bill starting the implementation of the declaration in June 2021. But it’s been a slow process since then. “There’s very little progress,” King said. “It’s bogged down in administrative morass.”The Atlas Network appears to be moving into a new phase of advocacy. At a conference in Guatemala earlier this year, leaders “from freedom-minded organizations, many of them Atlas Network partners”, gathered to “sharpen their plans for the coming year”.At this invitation-only event, MLI “workshopped a project to improve opportunities for native populations”, according to an Atlas Network write-up of the conference.MLI wanted to apply what it has learned in Canada globally. “The goal of the project would be to promote Indigenous economic development across the world,” Byers wrote.This story is a collaboration between Floodlight, The Narwhal and the Guardian.",
  "Sylvester Stallone has launched a verbal attack on veteran producer Irwin Winkler over the Rocky movies, describing Winkler as “untalented and parasitical” for not assigning him any portion of the rights to the boxing-movie series for which Stallone created the original characters and wrote and directed numerous entries.Stallone posted an offensive caricature of Winkler on social media, writing: “I really would like have at least a little WHAT’s LEFT of my RIGHTS back – I believe That would be a FAIR gesture from this 93 year old gentleman.”Observing that Winkler’s rights would presumably pass to his children, who include Rocky Balboa producers Charles and David Winkler, Stallone added: “This is a painful subject That eats at my soul, because I wanted to leave something of Rocky for my children.”Stallone also posted the cover of a novel by David Winkler (producer on all three Creed movies as well as Rocky Balboa), calling him “the painfully untalented … son of the remarkably untalented and parasitical [Irwin Winkler]”, and that “that crew are the worst unhunman [sic] beings I’ve ever met in the movie industry”. He also suggested that “if it wasn’t for Winkler, there would’ve been at least another three Rockys.”The Rocky series currently consists of six movies. The initial five, all written by Stallone, and three of which were directed by him, were released between 1976 and 1990; Stallone also wrote and directed Rocky Balboa, which came out in 2006. Stallone was a producer on the Creed spin-off movies: he was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for the 2015 release Creed, and is a credited writer on Creed II, which came out in 2018. A third Creed film is due to arrive in November 2022.In an interview in Variety in 2019, Stallone had complained about not having an equity stake in the franchise, saying: “It was shocking that it never came to be, but I was told, ‘Hey, you got paid, so what are you complaining about?’ I was furious.”Winkler’s representatives have been contacted for a response.",
  "Sri Lanka’s acting president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has declared a state of emergency as his administration seeks to quell social unrest and tackle an economic crisis gripping the island nation.“It is expedient, so to do, in the interests of public security, the protection of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community,” a government notice released late on Sunday said.Wickremesinghe had announced a state of emergency last week, after president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to escape a popular uprising against his government.It was unclear whether that order had been withdrawn or had lapsed, or whether Wickremesinghe had reissued the order in his capacity as acting president, having been sworn in on 15 July. A spokesperson for Wickremesinghe’s office did not respond to Reuters request for comment.Sri Lanka crisis timeline: from galloping inflation to a president’s resignationRead moreThe specific legal provisions of the latest emergency are yet to be announced by the government but previous emergency regulations have been used to deploy the military to arrest and detain people, search private property and dampen public protests.The country’s commercial capital, Colombo, remained calm on Monday morning, with traffic and pedestrians out on the streets.Bhavani Fonseka, senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives, said declaring a state of emergency was becoming the government’s default response.“This has proven ineffective in the past,” Fonseka told Reuters.Rajapaksa’s resignation was accepted by parliament on Friday. He flew to the Maldives and then Singapore after hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters came out on to the streets of Colombo a week ago and occupied his official residence and offices.Sri Lanka’s parliament met on Saturday to begin the process of electing a new president, and a shipment of fuel arrived to provide some relief to the crisis-hit nation.Wickremesinghe, an ally of Rajapaksa, was nominated by the ruling party as its candidate to be the next president but protesters also want him gone, leading to the prospect of further unrest should he be elected.Wickremesinghe was appointed interim president on Friday after informally occupying the role since Wednesday, and the announcement was greeted with anger and frustration on the streets of Colombo.Wickremesinghe, who has now been prime minister six times, stands accused of protecting and propping up the Rajapaksa family dynasty for years, shielding them from corruption charges and enabling their return to power.His decision to agree to become a caretaker prime minister two months ago was seen by many as the reason Rajapaksa stayed in power for weeks longer than he would have otherwise.The public frustration at Wickremesinghe has manifested multiple times, from his private residence being burned down to his offices being stormed by protesters on Wednesday.Wickremesinghe will be the candidate for the Rajapaksas’ ruling party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which still has the largest number of seats in parliament. He stands a high chance of being elected after the vote by MPs in parliament scheduled for next Tuesday or Wednesday.Wickremesinghe’s nomination even appeared to cause divisions with the SLPP. The party chair, GL Peiris, sent a letter to the party’s general secretary expressing “amazement and total disbelief” at the statement that it would be backing Wickremesinghe as its presidential nominee.However, Wickremesinghe will be up against several candidates in the presidential secret ballot next week, including the leader of the opposition, Sajith Premadasa – who has vowed to make sure “an elective dictatorship never, ever occurs” and go after the leaders who “looted the country” – and another SLPP politician, Dullas Alahapperuma, which could split the vote of the ruling party.Former army chief Sarath Fonseka has also signalled his intention to run.",

  "Name: Workplace emojis.Age: 25. The first set of emojis hit Japanese phones in 1997.Appearance: Ever more various, including a heatwave-appropriate “melting face”, and multiracial handshakes in the latest release.OK, but why did you just email me a yellow waving hand? Just being friendly with a colleague.Hmph. I loathe emojis. They are an infantilising impoverishment of language. Have you ever considered you might be the one with impoverished language? In a recent survey of 9,400 workers worldwide by the messaging platform Slack and the language app Duolingo, 58% of respondents said they would consider an emoji-less work message “lacking”. Do you never use emojis at work?Never. Well, I have very occasionally succumbed to the skull. And what do you use it for?Death, pestilence, an oblique commentary on Alan from marketing’s poorly formatted PowerPoints. This is a case in point: younger workers often use the skull to convey that something is “dead funny”. The survey found that generational differences in how we use and interpret emojis are creating all sorts of awkwardness and misunderstanding. For instance, what do you think a classic smiley means?Presumably it expresses satisfaction, perhaps at the felicitous wording of a memo? Not for the 9% of people (and 20% of Americans) who use it for “deep exasperation and/or distrust”. How about the aubergine?If pressed, I would use it to inform people that my legendary baba ganoush is available in the third-floor kitchen. This is where some of the worst problems arise: older workers sending colleagues emojis that are distinctly not safe for work. A winky face is considered not just jokey but flirtatious by younger people, and anything with a tongue, peach, taco or aubergine is strongly discouraged.But this is going to play havoc with working lunches. Basically, it’s best to avoid any emoji that could be misunderstood, or make you seem creepy and inappropriate to younger colleagues.I see. Is this a bit like David Cameron using LOL for “lots of love”? Sure, an excellent, up-to-date analogy. 🙃 Hang on, is that sarcasm? 🤐There’s an easy solution to this problem: stick to the language of Shakespeare in work communication. The same Shakespeare who wrote a famously filthy innuendo involving fruit (medlar and pear) in Romeo and Juliet?

But that would be wrong because the popular style of politics they’ve inflicted on this country is deeply dangerous.\nThe risk of a frightening descent into what the honourable member for Paisley and Renfrewshire South (Mhairi Black) bravely and correctly called out in May: fascism. As she said back then, fascism doesn’t always arrive wearing jackboots, it can come knocking more subtly than that.\nWell, students of fascism have helpfully suggested some of its signs: disinformation, misogyny, disdain for intellectuals, social conformity, suppression of trade unions, threats to human rights, the creation and abuse of hate groups, the rise of militarisation and, of course, racism, which is at the heart of fascism.\nDo any of these sounds familiar? There is a pattern here, if only we are prepared to see it. We like to tell ourselves that we live in a mature democracy. Yet this populist government has deliberately set out to weaken the very institutions that define a liberal democracy.1h ago21.00Penny Mordaunt, who came second in the vote but lost one of her votes, said:My vote is steady and I’m grateful to my colleagues for all their support and thrilled to be in second place once more.\nMPs know that I’m a strong candidate, running a truly clean campaign and putting forward a positive vision for the party and our country.Mordaunt, who will be hoping to benefit from Tom Tugendhat being eliminated said he was a friend and colleague who she has admired for years and said:I know that we are both committed to a clean start for our party and I believe he is one of the strongest assets on the Conservative green benches.\nIt was an honour to stand alongside him in this contest.1h ago20.58Following the results of tonight’s Tory leadership vote, Kemi Badenoch tweeted that it was “all to play for” and that she was “in it to win”.She said:Continued momentum, closing the gap, I am the only change candidate left in the race.

They spend more time and energy protecting statues than protecting women from domestic abuse.\nThey deliberately drive wedges between people over gender identity and trans rights and ignore the fact that their own equalities minister resigned because he thought the Government was creating a hostile environment for LGBT people.Bryant then pointed at Tory MP Chris Clarkson, who had just finished a speech giving his backing to the government and who is gay, and said:Which is why he should be ashamed to defend this government.Raising a point of order, Clarkson asked whether pointing at him was in order, but Deputy Speaker Dame Rosie Winterton said it would have been “appropriate” for the Conservative MP to try to intervene in Bryant’s speech instead.Bryant and Clarkson could later be seen speaking to each other in angry but hushed tones across the Commons chamber, each telling the other they should be ashamed.Updated at 19.58 BST2h ago19.34Labour MP Diana Johnson has tweeted to say the vote of confidence debate is “one of the nastiest” she has ever experienced.In the House of Commons chamber in the #VoteOfConfidence debate.

  "In a remote stretch of southern California desert, at least 200 unhoused people live outside, battling the extremes: blazing hot temperatures in the summer, snow in winter, rugged terrain inaccessible to many vehicles, a constant wind that blankets everything with silt, and no running water for miles.For Candice Winfrey, the conditions almost proved deadly.The 37-year-old lives in a camper in the Mojave desert, on the northern edge of Los Angeles county, miles from the nearest store. During a record-breaking heatwave in July 2020, she found herself running out of water. The jug of a gallon she had left had overheated, the water so hot it was barely drinkable. It was more than 110F (43C), and no one was around to help. She recalled lying in her tent, trying not to think about the heat exhaustion and dehydration overtaking her. “I thought I was gonna die. I was seeing the light. I was just waiting it out and praying to God that I’d make it.”Candice Winfrey lives in a camper in the Mojave desert, where water is hard to come by.Eventually, she drifted off into a sleep state, she said, reawakening hours later after the sun had started to set and someone came by with cooler water.Previously, Winfrey and others had pitched tents and parked their trailers in the nearby city of Lancaster. But sheriff’s deputies and other authorities there in recent years have cracked down on homelessness, banning people from camping in certain spots, giving out citations for “loitering” and related violations and conducting encampment sweeps that advocates say destroy people’s belongings.Map of Los Angeles county in southern California. Los Angeles is marked in the south, Lancaster in the north, and the Mojave desert region is further north.The measures, unhoused Lancaster residents say, in effect banished them to unincorporated desert land. There, they face less police harassment, but live isolated from paved roads and basic services in town.As the region enters another brutally hot summer, the crisis has become a public health disaster – one that advocates say illustrates deep flaws in California’s homelessness response.Data obtained by the Guardian shows that the coroner’s office has logged 246 deaths of unhoused people in Lancaster and the surrounding area since 2015, including 18 deaths in the desert and 29 fatalities so far this year. The deaths sharply increased during the pandemic and include causes such as heatstroke, hypothermia, homicide, heart disease and overdose. The numbers are considered a significant undercount.“The county isn’t treating this like a humanitarian crisis,” said Eve Garrow, policy analyst and advocate at the ACLU of Southern California, who has worked with desert residents. “Instead of providing aid, law enforcement displaces them to remote areas so far away from resources that it’s a danger to their health and their lives.”A police crackdownOn a recent windy afternoon, the temperatures outside of Winfrey’s camper reached 90F (32C) – the coolest it had been that week.The region where people camp lies just north of the Lancaster city limits, located in a picturesque landscape that resembles that of Joshua Tree and other national parks, but without the designated hiking routes and amenities. Discarded items of furniture line the bumpy, off-road paths that lead to the tents and RVs, but little else is visible except sand in every direction and mountains in the distance.Residents are scattered in small communities dispersed throughout the desert, with some couples and individuals in isolated pockets on their own while others cluster together for safety and support. The campers have different stories about how they ended up there: they escaped domestic violence, lost a home during a divorce or to a fire, faced eviction during the pandemic, struggled with addiction, were ostracized because they were LGBTQ+ or were forced to leave home.At least 200 people live outside in this remote stretch of the Mojave, where the temperatures can easily top 100F in the summer.But many of them were first unhoused on the streets of Lancaster.LA county has received international scrutiny for its homelessness catastrophe and worsening inequality. It’s home to some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country, yet has an estimated 66,000 unhoused residents and accounts for 20% of all Americans living outside.While California is spending an unprecedented amount of money to address this, including by constructing more housing, the fixes have not met the demands, and people are falling into homelessness faster than the unhoused are moving indoors. There have been high-profile encampment shutdowns in the city of LA, in areas such as Venice Beach and Echo Park Lake.Lancaster’s response has been to criminalize unhoused people’s existence, advocates say.Lancaster counted 2,053 unhoused people in January 2020 – the latest available data, which is considered an undercount – and the vast majority were living outside in makeshift shelters and vehicles.Number of deaths of unhoused people in the Lancaster area from 2018 through 3 July. So far this year, there have been 29 deaths.But through encampment sweeps and an aggressive ticketing strategy, they’ve slowly forced people out.“The city of Lancaster treats us like we are a lost cause, like we’re just bums and alcoholics, like we’re dirty and they don’t want to see us,” said Winfrey, who said she became unhoused in Lancaster after relapsing in her struggle with addiction, and losing a job.She said she used to camp in several locations within the city, including by old train tracks, but authorities kept forcing her to move, leading her to the desert. She is waiting for a subsidized housing voucher. “We are still people. We don’t have to be treated like animals or barbarians,” she said.Timothy Galloway Jr stands near an RV. Encampment sweeps an an aggressive ticketing strategy have slowly forced people out of Lancaster.While unhoused people make up nearly 1.3% of the Lancaster population, they accounted for 48% of all police stops for minor municipal code violations in 2020, according to the ACLU, which analyzed public arrest records and obtained citation documents from the LA sheriff’s department (LASD).Some of the tickets, which were shared with the Guardian, suggest police were explicitly targeting people because they were unhoused.In March 2019, for example, an LASD deputy took an unhoused man to jail on a solicitation charge, citing as evidence the man’s sign that said, “Anything helps. God bless.” The next month, a man was accused of loitering, and when he rode off on his bike, police followed him and cited him. Another man was questioned by police outside a shopping center and explained he was “sitting in the shade”, but officers gave him a loitering ticket because he “had all his personal items laid out”. Others have been ticketed for having shopping carts and tents or simply for “illegal camping”.There are also significant racial disparities in the stops: Black residents are 22% of the Lancaster population, but make up 52% of the loitering tickets.Facing the threat of tickets, which can turn into warrants for arrest and jail time, some say the desert is their only option.‘Waiting to die’Out in the desert, residents say they rely on help from a local ACLU chapter and other volunteers who visit them – and they have little hope government workers will come to their aid. The ACLU counted roughly 200 people there on a recent visit, though some advocates believe the number is higher.Christopher Saunders became unhoused after losing work as a plumber during the pandemic.Christopher Saunders, 35, said one encampment sweep in Lancaster cost him family photos and other belongings. Saunders said he was born and raised in the area and became unhoused after losing work as a plumber during the pandemic. After decamping to the desert, he built an impressive structure out of wood, giving him a fence and a roof. He said police don’t bother them much, though occasionally come around to check if people have warrants. When they do show up, they don’t offer services, he said.He’s given up hope of getting housing, he said: “Trying to figure out how to eat and get water every day, you don’t have time for nothing else.”Saunders goes into a nearby town once a week to fill up a 450-gallon tank with water, but when his car breaks down he has to walk miles back and forth: “It takes all day to get 10 gallons.”The struggle for water is a key concern for almost every resident in this extreme climate.A stuffed animal is discarded in the desert sand.

But everyone has been driving less because of gas prices, she said. “Without water, your skin starts drying up and cracking. The sun does damage to you out here. It knocks you out and removes your energy.” She said she’s trying to navigate the complex housing process, but some days feels too drained to get anything done.Garrow, the ACLU analyst, recalled meeting one woman in the area who told her she had walked miles carrying five gallons of water back to her camping site. She collapsed upon her return and her phone died, preventing her from seeking help. She rationed water, until her daughter eventually found her: “She was waiting to die and she probably would have if her daughter hadn’t rescued her.”A plea for aidThe ACLU has urged the local LA county supervisor, Kathryn Barger, whose district includes Lancaster, to seek an end to policies that criminalize the unhoused in Lancaster, including tickets, fines and sweeps.The civil rights group, which took Barger’s staff out to visit residents in the desert in February, also urged the county to provide water and sanitary services to people living outside, that the county allocate more resources to permanent supportive housing options and that service providers offer them without threats of arrest.Barger’s office met with advocates again in June, but nothing has changed, the ACLU said. “We’ve been having meetings for a year. How many can we have before you do something? It’s so dangerous out there,” said Ruth Sanchez, an ACLU advocate who drops off supplies weekly.Melissa Ivory relies on others to get water and other supplies in the desert. ‘The sun does damage to you out here,’ she says.Barger did not respond to questions about homelessness in the Lancaster region, but said in a statement: “I am deeply concerned by the increasing rates of homelessness and homeless related deaths in Los Angeles, especially those in [my district]. It is unacceptable and a grim reminder that the status quo isn’t working.” She said the county was in the process of revamping  its approach to how it coordinates services.Barger’s spokesperson referred inquiries to the county public health department and the LA County Homeless Initiative, which oversees homelessness spending and housing efforts, and both agencies declined to comment. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (Lahsa), which does outreach across the county, did not respond to inquiries about desert residents. LASD, run by a sheriff who has campaigned on a platform of cracking down on homelessness, declined to comment.Lancaster’s mayor, R Rex Parris, has criticized the ACLU, telling a local reporter last year: “We’re not dropping these people out in the desert. I don’t want people out there with no water. But they’d rather go out into the desert than go back to LA where they’re [at risk of being] raped and killed.” He said he was not at “war” with unhoused people, but added, “Am I going to allow people to sleep wherever they want and try and get money from people who are shopping? That’s not going to happen.” Parris, a Republican, also made headlines when he suggested residents arm themselves in response to the growing unhoused population. He defended his comments by calling unhoused people “criminals and thugs”.Aletha Johnston, 68, holds a baby guinea pig outside of her home in the Mojave desert. Lancaster’s mayor has called unhoused people ‘criminals and thugs’.A Lancaster city spokesperson pointed to the city’s new 14-acre campus that provides unhoused people with services and living quarters, including 150 permanent supportive housing units, and said there were four additional housing projects in the works meant for currently or formerly unhoused people. The spokesperson did not respond to questions about any efforts to assist people in the desert.Parris defended law enforcement’s treatment of the unhoused, saying in a statement: “It continues to be in the public interest that persons who commit misdemeanor offenses be held accountable for their crimes.” He also said the city’s goal is to divert people from the criminal system when possible, and that he doesn’t want “low-level offenders to have criminal records”. The mayor said that the city abides by court rulings that prohibit the arrest of unhoused people for sleeping in public, unless shelter is offered.Tracey Sutton, 47, who grew up in Lancaster and now has a tent and RV in the desert, scoffed at the mayor’s suggestion that people wanted to be there or were coming from outside of the region to camp there.“Lancaster is my home, my home. Why should I have to leave my home?” said Sutton, who has been unhoused for several years but moved from the city to the desert last year. Pointing to her RV, she added: “I have a home, I just have nowhere to park it.” The shelter options she has been offered would not allow her to stay with her husband or keep her dogs, she said.Tracey Sutton said she has refused shelter offers because they would not allow her to stay with her husband or keep her dogs.If officials aren’t going to get them housing, they could at least stop hassling them, Sutton added: “We’re not bothering you. Leave us alone.”But some desert residents are worried that even out in their remote camping spots, they will once again have to move. In recent weeks, someone put up a large sign near some of their RVs that read: “No parking. No trespassing. Violators will be prosecuted.”Residents aren’t sure who put it up or who might be enforcing it, but they are bracing for the worst: that they may have to move even further out into the desert this summer.",

  "Generations of the royal family have concealed details of assets worth more than £180m through a series of legal applications that have been granted in total secrecy.The assets are outlined in 33 wills that were drawn up by members of the Windsor family over more than a century.The family have been able to keep secret the contents of the wills by securing a special carve-out from a law that normally requires British wills to be published.The sealing of the wills has enabled the Windsors to avoid the public seeing what kinds of assets – such as property, jewels and cash – have been accumulated by members of the royal family and how these were then distributed to, for example, relatives, friends or staff.However, the Guardian has been able to calculate the overall size of the wealth passed down by many members of the family, as the value of their estates has been published in public registers and declassified government files.This shows that the Windsor family, whose wealth is opaque, have been able to keep secret wills that contain assets totalling – at today’s figures – £187m. Because the contents remain secret, some assets may have appeared in multiple wills and been counted more than once.At the top of the league is the Duke of Fife, who married Princess Louise, a daughter of King Edward VII. When the duke died in 1912, he left behind a fortune that is worth the equivalent today of £79m.Nine other wills contain assets worth between £5m and £11.7m if translated into today’s figures. They include Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister, who left £7.7m (£11.5m at today’s prices) when she died in 2002.Attorney general accused over Queen Mother’s will cover-upRead moreWills drawn up by a succession of minor royals including grandchildren of Queen Victoria have been kept secret. One of the more remote relatives was a member of the Danish royal family, Prince George Valdemar Carl Axel, who was born in Denmark and was a second cousin to Prince Philip. He lived in Britain and married a viscountess who was a distant relative of the royal family.His will was sealed in London after his death in 1986. His estate was valued at £785,000 (£1.8m at today’s prices).The arcane practice of keeping secret the wills of members of the royal family is due to come under scrutiny in a court case that starts on Wednesday. The Guardian is taking legal action to challenge a decision to exclude the media from a court hearing that resulted last year in a ruling that kept secret the Duke of Edinburgh’s will.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTFor decades, lawyers for the royal family have obtained legal orders from high court judges to have the contents of wills kept confidential after relatives have died. Since 1911, all the court hearings in which senior judges granted these orders have been held behind closed doors.This practice has been controversial, since wills belonging to members of the general public are ordinarily made public after they die. They are generally published in order to ensure that they are correctly implemented and are not subjected to any fraud. Legislation from the 1800s bans the publication of the monarch’s will.Secret wills of the royals - a tale of mistresses, jewels and cover-upsRead moreFor more than a century, high court judges who decided that the wills should be kept secret also concluded that their judgments explaining their rulings should not be published.The first judgment to be made public was last September, when a high court judge – Sir Andrew McFarlane, the president of the family division – published his ruling that Prince Philip’s will should not be made public.He decided that the wills of senior royals should be confidential as it was “necessary to enhance the protection afforded to the private lives of this unique group of individuals, in order to protect the dignity and standing of the public role of the sovereign and other close members of her family”.Lawyers for Philip also successfully applied to keep secret the value of the assets contained within his will.As with all the other hearings, the media were prevented from attending or even being allowed to argue why they should be able to attend.In its legal challenge to be heard over two days, the Guardian is arguing that the high court failed to properly consider whether the press should be allowed to attend the hearing, and that its failure to allow the media to make representations constitutes such a serious interference with the principle of open justice that the case should be reheard.The application is being opposed by the attorney general’s department, which declined to comment as the legal case was being heard.Buckingham Palace declined to comment in detail. A spokesperson said: “The treatment of wills is a matter for the executors of estates.” The spokesperson added that the executors of any Briton could apply to have a will sealed. It is not known how many wills of Britons – outside of the royal family – have been closed after legal applications.Wills of members of the royal family that have been sealed\nThe values of their estates (total wealth when they died) is given where known, along with the equivalent value at today’s prices, using the Bank of England inflation calculator.

  "Like a three-dimensional De Chirico painting or an Escher staircase to nowhere, the labyrinthine Espai Corberó near Barcelona defies architectural logic, being designed “without plans, obeying only space and poetry”.“It’s not my home, it’s a place I made with the help of patrons and buyers as a home for my sculptures,” the artist Xavier Corberó told the art magazine AD shortly before his death at 81 in 2017.Now, five years on, the site has been acquired for €3m (£2.4m) by the local council in Esplugues de Llobregat to be used as a public space.Eduard Sanz, the local mayor, said the council had acquired “new cultural facilities that would be of great benefit to the town”, without specifying exactly what the site – whose eight buildings occupy 2,000 sq metres (0.5 acres) – would be used for.Espai Corberó became an obsession for its creator, being sculpture as architecture or, some would say, an enormous folly.Asked by a visitor what the point of it all was, Corberó replied: “I carry on making. It’s enough to imagine something and feel the need to make it visible. That’s how art should be, or something very like that.”House of Xavier Corberó near Barcelona. Photograph: Mari Luz Vidal for Openhouse Magazine“This staircase goes somewhere and it does a good job of going there,” he added. “Who cares where it goes?”Corberó, whose works are exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and who counted Salvador Dalí, Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp among his friends, began work on the complex in 1968 and in due course it became his workshop and a museum dedicated to his work.The site comprises a series of 12 patios linked by 300 arches, creating an atmosphere both surreal and futuristic. There is an underground theatre with seating for 250 people.At the age of 19, Corberó, a native of Esplugues, formally renounced his inheritance to dedicate himself to art without financial support.

The complex has also been used for fashion shoots but is in a state of disrepair and its only inhabitant is Midu Rica, Corberó’s widow.",
  "Princesses, overpriced theme parks and a rapacious commercialisation of childhood: these would have been my suggestions if I’d been asked six months ago what I thought were Walt Disney’s legacies. Which isn’t to say that I’m anti-Disney. At all. Every generation has their Disney, and just as I grew up singing along to Ariel in The Little Mermaid and Mrs Potts (so superior to Belle) in Beauty and the Beast, so my children are regularly babysat by Frozen and Encanto. I watched the films on a VHS, my children stream them, but the effect is the same: just one glimpse of the Magic Kingdom icon at the start of a Disney film acts like a stun gun on them, silencing them mid-argument then pinning them to the sofa.At moments like that, man, I love Disney. At other times, I feel less positively inclined. When I get on my highest of horses, I will argue that Disney has done to pop culture what McDonald’s has done to fast food: homogenising it and boiling it down to the most quickly digestible basics, dealing in broad strokes and gender stereotypes. By now, the Walt Disney Company owns – as far as I can tell – every last bit of entertainment that isn’t Amazon or Netflix, and we live in a Disneyfied world, with little girls wearing Elsa fancy dress and boys opting for Captain Jack Sparrow. But what really is Walt’s legacy?Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.Maybe it’s your three-year-old singing We Don’t Talk About Bruno for the 752nd time in two days, making you want to tear off your own ears and eat them. Or maybe it’s harassed parents forking out $50 a head so the family can eat breakfast with someone in a Goofy suit at the theme parks’ (in)famous Character Breakfasts. Or maybe it’s the history of allegations from Disney park employees that they are so badly paid they can barely cover living costs. Given the Disney corporation’s energetic promotion of their founder’s image as a twinkly eyed benevolent genius, what would he think of the world he created?A few months ago, the podcast company Novel asked if I would narrate its upcoming 10-part series, Life and Death in the Magic Kingdom, written by Al Horner. It tells the life of Disney through the films made during Walt’s lifetime, with each episode dedicated to one film, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) to The Jungle Book (1967). Despite my lifelong history of watching Disney movies, and a subscription to Disney+ that I came to value during lockdown at least as much as my access to clean water, I knew almost nothing of Walt himself. He was cryogenically frozen? And had a real-life mouse named Mickey? So I said yes, partly out of curiosity. And I learned a lot while working on the series, including about the history of cryonics. I also learned that old Walt himself was no slouch when it came to stiffing his workers.But, really, I learned about the movies. The main reason I agreed to do the podcast was this sounded like a rare job with which my children could help me. My twin boys are six and my daughter is three so I pretty much live with a Disney test audience. So I sat down with the kids, ignored their wails as I scrolled past all the movies they recognised, and introduced them to old Disney. Vintage Disney. Real Disney.To all of our astonishment, they actually enjoyed them. I assumed that, as children of the CGI era, they would find the old movies’ hand drawings cold and inaccessible, but I underestimated the efficacy of Disney’s storytelling. Well, some of the time. Before we proceed, I shall list, in ascending order, how well the original Disney films went down with my kids: Fantasia; Pinocchio; Dumbo; Bambi; Alice in Wonderland; Cinderella; Snow White; Mary Poppins; The Jungle Book.That kids in 2022 don’t like Fantasia – Disney’s plot-free film featuring abstract animated interpretations of classical music – is not a massive surprise. Kids didn’t like it in 1940 when it was released, and who could blame them? Sure, it looks neat, but your enjoyment of Fantasia generally depends on how much LSD you’ve ingested that day, which is why the film enjoyed a surge of popularity in the 60s and 70s, and why it did not on my sofa.Bambi and Thumper … entertaining kids since 1942 despite that scene. Photograph: Disney/Allstar“But Pinocchio?!” you cry. “How could your kids not love Pinocchio, that adorable film about a puppet whose nose grows when he lies?” Well, dear readers, you clearly have not seen Pinocchio in a while. Not only is the nose shtick barely a thing in the film (one scene – literally one scene!), it seems to me to be a film with dark overtones of paedophilia, in which Pinocchio and other boys are kidnapped and taken to a place called – I kid you not – Pleasure Island. My bored and confused children had wandered off long before that delightful plot development, while I quietly gave thanks for the less complicated joys of Paw Patrol.There were some things they didn’t like about the original Disney films. The racism in Dumbo (1941) bewildered them – not so much the crow named Jim (what larks), which went entirely over my six-year-olds’ heads, but rather it was the faceless slaves at the beginning who sing merrily about working until “we’re almost dead” and address one another as “you hairy ape”. Was this supposed to be happy, because it didn’t seem like it, their baffled faces said. Just as well I didn’t subject them to Song of the South, a paean to the innate cheerfulness of slaves, which was made five years after Dumbo and which is very much not on Disney+.Walt Disney took often extremely harsh and strange stories and refashioned themThen there was the unexpected brutality of the old Disney movies. Sure, the modern films for kids contain jeopardy: is Andy outgrowing his toys in Toy Story? Can Riley get through puberty in Inside Out? Well, old Disney movies see that and raise you Dumbo torn away from his jailed, weeping mother; Snow White in a coffin; Bambi’s mother dying in the snow, which turns out to traumatise children today just as much as it did 80 years ago – thanks for that, Walt. Even Mary Poppins disappearing at the end of her film and Mowgli abandoning his animal family for some eight-year-old minx with a water jug have a degree of poignancy not seen in modern films. Life really was tougher in the old days.But in the main, my kids loved them. The Jungle Book and Mary Poppins they’d seen before, but Cinderella, Snow White and Alice in Wonderland were huge surprise hits – they genuinely loved them. How could they not? Modern kids’ films had trained them to do so, because they themselves had learned from the original Disney films how to tell stories. Olaf the chatty snowman in Frozen? The direct descendant of Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio. Disney and his team recognised that a chatty sidekick was essential as a moral anchor in this otherwise extremely weird story, and so moved away from the original source material, in which Pinocchio meets the cricket and, er, murders him. (Seriously, Pinocchio is crazy AF.)A common theory is that Disney’s anthropomorphised animals, especially Bambi, kickstarted the vegetarian movement in the US and, to a lesser extent, environmentalism. Possibly, but more obviously the film mainstreamed the use of cute talking animals in stories for kids, and it’s not too hard to trace a line from Thumper and the helpful mice in Cinderella to Bluey and Hey Duggee.Walt Disney took often extremely harsh and strange stories and refashioned them, removing the brutalism and bloodiness of the 19th century and replacing them with the soft focus of the 20th. That we remember Pinocchio for the nose rather than those dark overtones is testament to Disney marketing (and Disney himself learned his lesson on that movie when the film bombed with audiences due to its darkness). In Cinderella, he skipped over the stepsisters cutting off bits of their feet to fit into the glass slipper, as was in the Brothers Grimm story; in Snow White, he named the dwarves and gave them (vague) personalities. Alice in Wonderland is a pretty trippy movie, but nowhere near as much as Lewis Carroll’s book.Walt Disney “happily ever after-ed” kids’ stories, and that some of his films are now hopelessly dated is no surprise; the real shock is that so many are not. Disney reshaped modern childhood, and we still live in his shadow.Life and Death in the Magic Kingdom, narrated by Hadley Freeman, will air on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds in the autumn.",
  "It feels fitting in some ways that during a week that is hotter than Hades – when alarms bells about our direction of travel should be ringing even louder – Ben Stokes has announced his retirement from one-day international cricket.Yep, the champion all-rounder who powered England to World Cup victory by the barest of margins three summers ago, in front of a packed house at Lord’s and with the UK’s largest cricket audience since the heady 2005 Ashes, has decided the 50-over stuff must make way. If not, his schedule as an elite all-format player would become suffocating. The hope now is that this similarly prompts a wake-up call.Ben Stokes to retire from ODI cricket due to ‘unsustainable’ scheduleRead moreRather poetically, he will bid farewell to the format after winning his 105th ODI cap at the Riverside in Chester-le-Street, County Durham on Tuesday. It’s the ground that Ged and Deborah Stokes used to drive their restless, sports-mad son to from their home in Cockermouth some three times a week, two hours each way, in an act of selfless parenting that lit the fire for a remarkable sporting career.Ben Stokes, England cricketer and totemic Test captain, powers on, of course. In fact more so, in terms of where, aged 31, he wants to direct his energies. Modern all-format stars don’t tend to jack it all in at once anyway, rather strip away that which means least to them and design their latter years weighing up health, wealth and happiness.When they do so it says a bit about the player and plenty about the sport. And Stokes could not have been clearer about the bigger picture here, citing an “unsustainable schedule” and his fear of letting down teammates. For a cricketer paid by one of the boards responsible for this, to be so explicit in pushing back is quite the thing.After all, in practical terms Stokes didn’t have to announce this right now, so deep is his line of credit. He averaged 50 with the bat during Eoin Morgan’s five-year World Cup project, is a genuine sixth bowler and fields like a demon. Allied with talismanic dressing-room status and, as England’s highest earner, he could shoulder arms to any series he didn’t fancy between now and the defence in 2023 and likely still command a spot.Last week, as well as withdrawing from the upcoming Twenty20 series against South Africa to ready himself for the Test matches that follow, it was announced he would skip the Hundred this summer and his employers simply had to suck it up. No one batted an eyelid, nor would they were his ODIs to become fleeting.Ben Stokes had a disappointing ODI series against India, and has decided Tuesday’s game against South Africa will be his last 50-over game for England. Photograph: Ian Kington/AFP/Getty ImagesBut now was the time, like a leader, to take one for the team and give clarity in response to a fixture list that lacks anything of the sort. “I feel that my body is letting me down because of the schedule and what is expected of us,” he said. This announcement, decided last week but coming during a 48-hour turnaround between ODIs, was as sweetly timed as that famous swept six off Trent Boult at Lord’s three years ago.Stokes knows his mind and body have limits. So much so he wisely took a four-month break last summer when bereavement and injury proved an overwhelming mix. Since returning to mental and physical fitness – both boxes not fully ticked until the tour of the Caribbean in March, even if he still grimaces in the field at times – he has become ever more besotted with Test cricket and taken on tunnel vision with it.Matt Potts set for ODI debut as Mott pleads for patience with ButtlerRead more“I will give everything I have to Test cricket, and now, with this decision, I feel I can also give my total commitment to the T20 format,” he said in his statement. The latter’s appeal is understandable in the modern economic climate but, having passed up the Indian Premier League this year and hinted he’ll do so again before next summer’s Ashes assault, it is clear the type of cricket which is calling him.The alliance with the head coach, Brendon McCullum, has also begun in quite astonishing fashion – those four spellbinding run chases in a row – and you could almost sense during these last three ODIs that this goal is now consuming his every cricketing thought. Put simply, the Test team and winning back the urn from Australia has become an obsession and Stokes is a character who is all-in when hooked.The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.The fear, of course, is that his broader call for a cleaner schedule falls on deaf ears. The ICC (aka the major boards) is working on a schedule that, while pruning back some ODI cricket over the next five years, features a global men’s tournament every 12 months. If the 50-over format is on the way out, no one seems to have told the organisers of the 2023, 2027 and 2031 World Cups, or Champions Trophies in 2025 and 2029.Each of the ICC members will also jostle to promote their domestic leagues – but stop everything for the two and a half months of the IPL to keep their players happy – and somehow attempt to keep touring for their bilateral commitments, too.But on Tuesday, back where it all began for Stokes, it will at least be a chance for the English game to thank the all-rounder for his efforts as a World Cup-winning one-day international star and applaud his burning desire to keep the flame of Test cricket alive.",
  "Sergio Cossu’s nude awakening came in 1972, when, at the age of 16 and needing a getaway from his family, he ventured to Santa Teresa Gallura, whose stretch of wild, pristine coastline in northern Sardinia was a mecca for hippies from across Europe.“It was my first solo holiday away from the traditional family setting,” he said. “There was this feeling of an immense connection with nature; from that point on it was impossible to wear a costume on a beach again. There was less of a taboo about nudity back then but, paradoxically, naturism diminished in the 1990s with the explosion of gyms and this focus on having the perfect body. But over the last 20 years, there has been a revival.”Cossu is now among the members of Anita, the Italian naturist association, seeking to tap into that renaissance by working with local authorities across Sardinia to turn the lush Mediterranean island into a haven for nudist tourism.Even though nudist beaches have existed in Italy for decades, a law introduced in 2017 has enabled individual regions to legally dedicate stretches of coastline for naturists. Today, there are 17 official nudist beaches in Italy and beyond.Sardinia mapTuscany leads the way with five, but Sardinia is hoping to steal its crown. The island is not only planning to add to its list of three official beaches but also has visions of creating naturist hotels, hiking trails and even an entire village as it endeavours to attract a growing market – currently there are an estimated 50,000 naturists in Italy and 20 million in Europe.Luigi Tedeschi, the mayor of San Vero Milis, a tiny town along Sardinia’s central west coast, is among the local leaders getting on board. A section of Is Benas, a nearby 3km stretch of golden-sanded beach with dunes and a pine forest, was designated an official nudist spot in May. Tedeschi said the move drew a few sniggers in the town’s bar but was otherwise supported. “I’m 65 and remember the times when nudity on the beach was normal,” he said. “Is Benas was already being used by naturists – all we’ve done is regulate it.”Tedeschi’s goal is twofold: develop a remote area abundant in nature for a tourism market which, in turn, cares about protecting the environment.“We need to recognise the importance of accepting those who respect the environment,” he said. “Whenever nudists come to Is Benas, they always leave it clean. This should be the main thing – capturing the culture of naturism, not just seeing it as nudity. Sardinia is a paradise and this is the direction we should all be going in.”‘People want to get their clothes off’: naturists catch eye of UK businessesRead moreHowever, not everyone is happy about the growth of naturism in Italy, a country still influenced by a conservative Catholic culture despite dwindling numbers of churchgoers.Simone Atzeni, the owner of Arbus Adventures, a company offering boat and trekking tours in the vicinity of Piscinas beach, complained to the local authorities after they allocated a section for naturists, arguing that it should have been tucked much further away from their non-naked counterparts. “I respect the naturists, but the naturists also need to respect those who don’t want to expose themselves,” he said. “It was a mistake to give them that area of the beach as they are in plain sight of so many people who don’t like it.”Atzeni also doesn’t want to see any naked people walking the trails. “There is a spiritual path called Santa Barbara, named after a saint and used by believers and many women who walk alone. Would you like to be followed by someone nude?”Not so long ago, sunbathing nude on a beach in Italy could have landed you with a two-month prison term because owing to two laws, one dating back to the fascist period which stipulates nudity as shameful, it might have been deemed an obscene act in a public space. A supreme court ruling in 2006 paved the way to nudity being dropped as a criminal offence a decade later. However, it is still possible to be fined.“For this reason we have lawyers to help naturists who find themselves in this situation, as the fines can go up to €10,000,” said Giuseppe Ligios, a spokesperson for Anita. “It’s unthinkable to fine someone such a huge amount for sunbathing nude on the beach – it’s based on archaic laws that need to distinguish between what is an obscene act, such as having sex in a public space, and what is simply sunbathing naked.”Still, the threat of a fine or judgment is not deterring Italy’s naturists, 25% of whom are women. “Naturism has helped me to accept my body,” said Sara Pinna, who lives near Piscinas beach. “Especially for women, there is this social pressure to look beautiful and hide your imperfections, but through naturism, I can just say: ‘Look, this is me – this is how real people look.’”However, she has not managed to convert her husband. “He’s ashamed and worries about bumping into someone he knows. When we go to the beach together, I go naked and he wears his costume. Now that’s true freedom.”",

Quick as a flash, Cernoia runs forward and plays a good angled ball looking for Giacinti, but Evrard rushes off her line to gather.20m ago21.4279 min: The Italy captain Girelli and Bergamasco go off, for Sabatino and Cernoia.The departing Girelli looks angry, seeming to kick something as she trudges off, both frustrated with Italy’s failure to find a goal, but mainly (I suspect) that she’s been taken off with 10 minutes left on the clock.Updated at 21.44 BST23m ago21.3978 min: Now Giacinti has a sight of goal and hits a low angled shot for Italy, which flicks off an opponent and dribbles just wide!Updated at 21.39 BST23m ago21.3876 min: After Bonansea does well to flick a ball on, Girelli cracks over a powerful cross which flicks off Vanhaevermaet’s head. Bonfantini can’t get on the end of it. Both Italian players protest when a corner is not forthcoming. They know that time is running out.26m ago21.3573 min: Bonfantini hares down the right wing for Italy, chasing a pass which is sent over her head, but it bounces out for a throw. This must be a frustrating watch for Italy’s fans. They clearly have plenty of talent in the team but they cannot thread it all together and cut Belgium’s defence open. At least, not yet. There is still time.Updated at 21.36 BST30m ago21.3171 min: It remains 1-0 to France in their match against Iceland, so just to reiterate, Belgium will be going through as Group D runners-up as it stands.

Caruso and Boattin both have shots as the ball pinballs around the Belgium penalty area.

Valentina Giacinti, a forwaord, comes on for the midfielder Simonetti.35m ago21.2765 min: Boattin goes in the book for a very strong, some may say reckless, challenge on Eurlings. That said, Eurlings was off her feet as well and it was pretty much a 50-50.Eurlings immediately goes off (not injured - it’s a planned change) with Delacauw joining the action, with Deloose, the defender, also coming on for Vangheluwe.Updated at 21.27 BST38m ago21.2362 min: Giugliano wastes possession in midfield for Italy. Something they can ill afford to do. A couple of minutes ago, Marie Minnaert came on for Belgium, in place of Dhont. She will slot in on the right of their front three. It looks like they are preparing more substitutes, too.Updated at 21.24 BST41m ago21.2060 min: It would be wrong to say Italy totally dominated the first half but they definitely enjoyed more possession and looked the more progressive team. As it stands they are going to pay for their lack of cutting edge – which is also, of course, a testament to the quality of Belgium’s defending.Updated at 21.21 BST44m ago21.1858 min: Arianna Caruso comes on for Italy in midfield, with Rosucci being withdrawn from the action. Updated at 21.19 BST44m ago21.1757 min: Now it’s Bonansea’s turn to pose a threat for Italy. She receives the ball just outside the penalty area, cuts in beyond her marker and buys the space for a shot ... which is straight at the goalie. More good work from Italy.47m ago21.1553 min: Italy come again. Boattin floats in a cross from the left. Girelli tries to get a powerful header on it but cannot trouble the goalkeeper. Girelli is continuing to look for a yard of space, playing with her back to goal, and urging her teammates to find a telling ball either around the corner or to her feet. She is a classical Italian centre-forward and no mistake.49m ago21.1351 min: Bonfantini roars into the Belgium penalty area. Simonetti squares for Girelli, who hits an excellent first-time shot, right-footed, which cannons back off the crossbar! So close!

  "Michael Yormark initially sounds like an American sports agent straight out of central casting as, having started his day as usual at 3.30am because “greatness is a process” which requires dedication, the head of Roc Nation Sports slips into a smooth overview of how it feels to represent a roster of famous athletes including Romelu Lukaku, Kevin De Bruyne and Siya Kolisi. Yormark, an urbane 55-year-old who runs the London office of the company set up by Jay‑Z, has always followed a mantra of “every day I’ve got to be great”.Perhaps this is what you need to say to talk encouragingly to Lukaku each day, while negotiating with Chelsea’s new owner, Todd Boehly, to ease the return of an unhappy player to Internazionale, or when signing South Africa rugby’s first black captain soon after the country had won the World Cup. But Yormark is at his most interesting when discussing his new obsession with rugby, which he believes is a “sleeping giant”, or while reflecting on his struggle as an aspiring agent in New York in the late 1980s.‘I was praying: don’t let anybody kill me’ – Oleksandr Usyk on life in Ukrainian armyRead more“When I got out of graduate school I thought people would be lining up to hire Michael Yormark,” he says. “I remember sending out 365 résumés and I didn’t get one interview. I ended up in a retail sales job at Sam’s – Samson Clothing Store in Livingston, New Jersey.”Yormark nods when I ask if he was a good salesman. “I like fashion, so I was quite good. But it was very humbling because I went back to my old town. This went on for a year but all it did was burn a bigger fire inside me. I kept telling myself that when I got that first opportunity I was going to be super-super-successful. Lo and behold, a dear friend of my mother’s, who was a minority owner of the New York Yankees, called me out of the blue.”The post at the Yankees had been filled but, as a gesture of friendship to Yormark’s mother who brought up three children as a single parent, he was invited to a belated interview. Yormark aced it and got the job at the Yankees where he was driven by “the previous 12 months. I told myself: ‘I’ll never go back there. So every day I’ve got to be great. Every day I have to be better than the previous day.’ Even today that very humbling year drives me.”Yormark worked in baseball and ice hockey, where his ability to market and run a winter sport in Florida caught the eye of Jay-Z. He was persuaded to join the company in 2014 and is now the president of Roc Nation Sports International and, with his twin brother Brett, who is based in New York, the co-chief executive. He has shifted the organisation’s focus from the US to a global perspective which is epitomised by his personal absorption in football and rugby since he opened their London office in 2019.In 2015, Yormark explains, “Jérôme Boateng approached us but I didn’t know much about professional football. I didn’t even know who he was until I did my homework and realised he was a premier footballer for Bayern. We took on the challenge of helping him build his brand in America and I met agency heads and owners of clubs to understand how footballers were being represented.“Historically agents have focused only on: ‘How do I move a player from Team X to Team Y?’ They care about the transfer fee and their contract commission. But they don’t focus on a holistic approach to the athlete. How do we help them leverage their success to really plan for the future? Many athletes in Europe told me no one had ever discussed with them what they were thinking about 10 years from now. But we mentor and help them plan for the future.”Romelu Lukaku spoke to Michael Yormack every day during a difficult season with Chelsea before the agent secured a return to Internazionale. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianYormark is particularly close to Lukaku, who endured a difficult past season where, after his massive transfer to Chelsea, he fell out of favour. “There wasn’t a day where Rome and I didn’t communicate. It was a very complicated and challenging year for Rome that would ultimately prove to be a great year of personal growth. But it’s very tough and you need a great support team that boosts your spirits – but which also tells you: ‘It’s going to be OK. At the right time we’ll find the right solution.’”Did Chelsea handle the situation badly? “When you invest the kind of money that Chelsea did, you have to allow that player to play to his strengths. To ask Rome or any other top striker in the world to come to your club and play differently, and then not to perhaps communicate effectively with the player, makes it very challenging. I’ve been around coaches my entire career and a good coach is someone that understands how to manage different personalities and maximise their performances. I don’t think that happened this past year.”Yormark helped Lukaku return to Inter. “I’ve spent a lot of time with Todd Boehly and he is an incredible businessman and a really good person who tries to be sensitive to everyone. Todd’s been very successful with the LA Dodgers and he invests right. So he will be a fantastic owner and have lots of success with Chelsea.”De Bruyne is another key client but he requires less support. “My relationship with Kevin is very strong. We don’t speak every day but we message at least once a week. Kevin is very focused and one of the premier players in the world. He got married at a young age and he and his wife have a beautiful family. Rome’s at a different point in his life to Kevin, so our relationship is different.”Kevin De Bruyne is a lower maintenance client due to having a strong family structure around him to provide support. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWhile on his way to watch De Bruyne play for Manchester City in November 2019, Yormark resolved to sign a rugby player who now means so much to him. “I knew nothing about rugby,” Yormark says, “but I walked into my gym one morning and people were huddling around a big TV screen. I asked: ‘What are you guys watching? The World Cup? What World Cup? Oh, the Rugby World Cup. Wow!’ So I started casually watching it.“On the morning of the final, England against South Africa in Japan, I’m in a sprinter van with one of my [Roc Nation] owners driving to watch Kevin play. We watched the game and at the end I see this incredible individual lift the Webb Ellis trophy. Siya Kolisi is talking about the importance of this victory to a racially divided country. He is talking about how when we work together we can accomplish anything. I looked at my owner and said: ‘We’ve got to sign this guy.’ Two weeks later Siya was sitting right here in this office. We had a six-hour meeting and the rest is history. It’s been a life-changing relationship for me and a wonderful one for the company.”His friendship with the Springbok captain fuels his current obsession which has seen him become heavily involved as an adviser to the new United Rugby Championship. “I’ve always said, ever since I got into rugby a couple of years ago, that it’s a sleeping giant. My passion for rugby stems from Siya, because he’s truly educated me in the sport. The first rugby match that I went to live was with Siya in January 2020. The physicality of the sport and the passion of the fans made me fall in love with rugby right away.“A few weekends ago I went to two matches – the Premiership final, then England against the Barbarians. So much can be improved in terms of atmosphere. You see the fireworks when the players come out but there should be more fan engagement. The experience that takes place around the match is how you engage casual fans.Siya Kolisi lifts the Webb Ellis Cup after captainin South Africa to World Cup success in 2019. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“We saw a different final in Cape Town with the URC that same weekend. There seemed better fan engagement initiatives to keep people excited and, in South Africa, you see more diversity. You go to rugby here and you don’t see diversity. The primary demographic is middle-aged white men. That’s got to change. We’ve got to think out-of-the-box in rugby.”Yormark is most interested in club and provincial rugby as the embryonic URC include teams from South Africa, Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Italy. But the international game still dominates. “To me, it’s dysfunctional,” he says of rugby’s structure and constant warfare between clubs and their unions. “The fact that clubs are perceived as the feeder system to the national teams? Coming from America, I can’t even comprehend that. The clubs in America are kings. What concerns me specifically about rugby is that you’re asking club fans to support you as season-ticket holders and you’re asking corporations to be sponsors. Yet for large portions of the year your best players aren’t there. So there has to be better scheduling between club matches and the international fixtures. As a fan I want to root for a team and know the best players are there.”Yormark stresses that Roc Nation “help the URC grow their brand and help them with content from a commercial standpoint as well as a digital perspective”.Lungi Ngidi: ‘Racism is a factor in South Africa that must be addressed’Read moreHe seems bemused that the league, which used to be the modest Pro 14 without any South African teams, receives barely any coverage in England. “The league has made incredible inroads this year. Perhaps where the URC has come from has tarnished enthusiasm to cover the league. But the quality of play in the URC is different. The teams are different.”An American sports agent being swept away by an obscure rugby tournament might be unexpected but Yormark is convinced the URC will soon compete with the English Premiership. “Of course it can. Listen, greatness is a process. Let’s not forget this is year one of the URC. Their momentum going into year two is absolutely incredible. So the URC have the potential to be the Premier League of rugby. Will it take time? Yes. But there’s no question that they will ultimately get there.” This article was amended on 18 July 2022 to correct the spelling of Michael Yormark’s surname.",
  "Joe Biden is having a rough summer. The US supreme court has overturned Roe v Wade, ending federal protections for abortion access. Although gas prices are now falling, they remain high and have driven inflation to its largest annual increase in more than 40 years. West Virginia senator Joe Manchin has finally ended any hopes that the president had of passing a climate bill in Congress. With an evenly divided Senate, Biden’s options for addressing these problems – or enacting any of his other legislative priorities – are bleak.The American people have taken note. Biden’s approval rating has steadily fallen since April and now sits in the high 30s. A recent Monmouth poll found that only 10% of Americans believe the country is heading in the right direction.Biden in crisis mode as specter of one-term Carter haunts White HouseRead moreAmid this pessimism, Democrats are bracing for a potential shellacking in the midterm elections, as Republicans appear poised to regain control of the House of Representatives. Faced with a grim outlook for 2022, some Democrats are already looking ahead to 2024 and asking, is Joe Biden the best person to lead the party and the nation?Questions over whether Biden should seek re-election in 2024 have grown louder in recent weeks. A New York Times/Siena College poll taken this month found that 64% of Democrats say they would prefer a different nominee for 2024. Among Democrats under 30, that figure rises to 94%.Ellen Sciales, a spokesperson for the youth-led climate group Sunrise Movement, said voters of her generation have grown disillusioned with Biden and other Democratic party leaders. After turning out to vote at near-record levels in 2020, young voters are now watching in dismay as the climate crisis accelerates and reproductive rights are stripped away, Sciales said.“Democrats should be treating the loss of my generation as an existential threat,” Sciales said. “We’ve been warning Democrats that unless they pass real meaningful policy immediately, like what was promised in Build Back Better, they are going to lose the engagement of so many voters, threatening their chances in 2022, 2024 and even further.”Democrats should be treating the loss of my generation as an existential threatEllen ScialesIn addition to his sinking approval rating, Biden is facing increasingly pointed questions about his age. At 79 years old, Biden is already the oldest president in US history, and if re-elected, he would be 86 when his second term ended. The Times/Siena poll found that age and poor job performance ranked as the top two reasons why Democrats said Biden should not run again in 2024.The White House has publicly dismissed concerns about Biden getting older. “That is not a question that we should be even asking,” the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said last month.But some of Biden’s aides privately tell a different story. According to a recent New York Times report, White House staffers have expressed hesitation about scheduling long international trips for Biden, out of concern that they are too taxing for him. They also worry that Biden’s slower, more shuffling gait could cause him to fall, and they fret over his tendency to jumble words in speeches. David Axelrod, who previously served as Barack Obama’s chief campaign strategist, has said that Biden’s age could be a “major issue” if he seeks re-election.A New York Times columnist last week wrote an article titled “Joe Biden is Too Old to be President Again”, but pointed out that this was a wider problem with US politics. “There’s a problem here that goes beyond Biden himself. We are ruled by a gerontocracy. Biden is 79. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is 82. The House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, is 83. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, is 71. Often, it’s not clear if they grasp how broken this country is.”Biden insists he still plans to run again in 2024, assuming his health cooperates. “I’m a great respecter of fate. Fate has intervened in my life many, many times,” Biden said in December. “If I’m in the health I’m in now, if I’m in good health, then in fact, I would run again.”But those comments have not quelled the 2024 conversation, even among fellow Democrats. When progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was asked whether she would endorse Biden as the Democratic nominee in 2024, she demurred.“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it,” Ocasio-Cortez said last month. Weeks later, she dodged questions from late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert about whether she would consider launching her own presidential campaign in 2024.If Ocasio-Cortez or another progressive leader chose to challenge Biden, it would be a historic candidacy. No sitting Democratic president has faced a primary challenge since 1980, when Ted Kennedy chose to run against Jimmy Carter as the country faced record-high inflation and gas shortages. Carter was able to defeat Kennedy in the primary, but he ultimately lost the general election to a Republican candidate who promised to “make America great again”: Ronald Reagan..Jon Ward, author of Camelot’s End, which chronicles the 1980 Democratic primary, said there are some clear parallels and important distinctions between Carter and Biden. While Carter had a clear-cut opponent in Kennedy, it remains unclear who – if anyone – from the Democratic party’s highest ranks would challenge Biden.But one element working in Biden’s favor is time, Ward said. The 2024 presidential election is still more than two years away, giving the economy some breathing room to return to a place of greater stability.“There’s time for inflation to ease and for the economy to turn around,” Ward said. “However, it’s not clear that’s where we’re headed, since there are a lot of forecasts of recession and even the prospect of the very ‘stagflation’ that crippled Carter.”Biden’s allies insist he has time to improve the economy and the nation’s broader outlook, and they are generally dismissive of polls indicating he should step aside in 2024.Polls are a snapshot of the timeAntjuan Seawright“Polls are a snapshot of the time,” said Antjuan Seawright, Democratic strategist and senior adviser to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Truth be told, what’s hot today could be cold tomorrow, and what’s cold today, it could be very hot tomorrow.”Seawright criticized the recent 2024 chatter as “a manufactured outrage from a few in our party”, suggesting those who are engaging in the speculation should instead rededicate themselves to the midterm elections.Even some of the progressives who did not support Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary echo that point. Rahna Epting, executive director of the progressive group MoveOn, said she has not yet been talking about the 2024 election because of her single-minded concentration on the midterms.Emphasizing the urgency of the upcoming elections, Epting noted that some of the gubernatorial, state legislative and secretary of state races being held this year will have sweeping implications for 2024. A number of Republican candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 race are now running for posts that could help them determine election rules in 2024.“We’re going to find out whether our elections in 2024 are going to be free and fair, based on who ends up in office in 2022,” Epting said. “The very terrain of our democracy and our election system is going to be decided this election cycle.”",
  "The price of oil rose on Monday after the US president, Joe Biden, came away from talks in the Middle East without an agreement on raising supply.Biden had hoped to secure a promise from Saudi Arabia to increase its output of oil, which could lead to an easing of global supply pressures.But Brent crude rose 2.6% to $103.88 (£86.91) on Monday after Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, quelled speculation over an output increase.Oil climbs after Biden fails to secure Saudi output hike – business liveRead moreHe said that officials at a US-Arab summit on Saturday did not discuss oil and that the Opec+ oil cartel nations would continue to assess market conditions.Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: “The message is that it is Opec+ that makes the oil supply decision, and the cartel isn’t remotely interested in what Biden is trying to achieve.“Opec+ will continue to control oil supply, and one country alone cannot determine the oil supply – at least that is the message that traders have taken from Biden’s visit to Saudi Arabia.The increase in oil prices will keep up the pressure at the pumps, where drivers have faced record petrol and diesel prices. Prices have climbed so high that the government asked the Competition and Markets Authority to study the market and its initial findings raised concerns over the margins made by refineries.However, Brent crude prices have eased since the highs of about $130 in March during the early weeks of the war in Ukraine.Oil prices ended last week lower for the fifth consecutive week. Concerns over the potential for a global recession has sent investors fleeing from commodity markets.The price of copper – known as Dr Copper as it is considered a barometer for the health of the world economy – has fallen 25% since its March peaks.Energy traders are also closely watching the price of gas amid a dash for supplies in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskCountries are racing to fill up their gas storage in case Russia cuts off supplies, including through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which is closed for maintenance.The chemicals group Ineos, one of Europe’s biggest gas users which is run by the billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, echoed comments from the Shell chief executive, Ben van Beurden, that rationing could be introduced this winter.“It looks pretty dire for this winter now, as to whether we’ll get to the targets we need for storage,” Brian Gilvary, the executive chairman of Ineos, told Bloomberg Television. “If Nord Stream 1 doesn’t come back, it is inevitable. We will definitely see rationing in Europe.”",
  "Be careful what you wish for. Just a week ago, televised leadership debates had been a no-brainer for the Conservative party. A chance to introduce its candidates to an audience who might otherwise have known little about the MPs eyeing up the Downing Street wallpaper. A showcase for the range and depth of talent within the Tories. Or maybe not. For what the debates have revealed is not the gravitas but the sheer levitas. A gaggle of contenders with selective memories, fighting like rats in a sack and who barely agree over anything. From knowing too little, the country knows far too much. The rotting entrails have been exposed.The third TV debate was originally scheduled for Monday evening. Up until someone realised that would clash with the third round of voting. Though that could have livened up proceedings for the rest of us. Rather than hearing the same five candidates reheating their tired lines and animosity for the third time in four days, we could have had someone eliminated on live TV. Proper jeopardy. “You are the Weakest Link. Goodbye.”So the debate was then moved to Tuesday only for Ready4Rish! and Liz Truss to pull out within minutes of each other on Monday morning. Almost as if it had been coordinated by Tory HQ. Heaven forbid. Rish! had apparently got tired of making fun of how hopeless Truss was – why was he being so horrible to Liz in public, he had asked. Because it’s easy and the misfiring, robotic Truss was so useless. Obvs. On many occasions her face had been the computer’s spinning circle of doom – and wasn’t going to reengage until the last stages of the contest. Though if Liz made it to the last two he would happily restart the trash talking.Truss was adamant that she wouldn’t take part in any debate unless all five of Friday’s and Sunday’s lineup was included. Which rather suggested she hadn’t understood the format of the leadership contest. Someone explain this to her, please.Penny Mordaunt had been happy to go ahead and blamed the cancellation on Rish! and Truss being unable to be civil to one another. Before she remembered that wasn’t Tory HQ’s preferred message and contradicted herself. Rish! and Truss had been getting on too well with each other. That was it! That was why the debates were a goner. Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat said nothing. Presumably because they had seen the numbers and realised they would have been unlikely to take part on Tuesday. So the Tories kicked away one more democratic plank in the interests of self-preservation.Meanwhile over in the Commons, Boris Johnson took time out from his fantasies of being a Typhoon pilot to cosplay the role of prime minister for what might be the last occasion. It’s still odds on he finds an excuse to fly to Kyiv to say goodbye to Volodymyr Zelenskiy rather than show up for PMQs on Wednesday. These days the Convict gets to pick and choose what takes his fancy. Obviously chairing Cobra meetings on extreme temperatures was far too dull. Especially when there were parties at Chequers to be had.But if this was to be Johnson’s last stand, it was somehow fitting it should be on a debate of no consequence. A premiership that degraded the office with lies and incompetence should end in the futility of a no-confidence vote with no meaning. And laced with its own internal contradictions. Just because the Tory party had chosen to remove the Convict as its leader it somehow didn’t follow he was unfit to remain prime minister and run the government. Go figure.There were plenty of gaps on the Tory backbenches for Johnson’s last hurrah, though the ever loyal Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg cosied up close to keep the flame alight for a while longer. Along with the vacant Truss. Selling herself to the party as the continuity Boris candidate while happily trashing his economic record in government. Then, nothing much makes sense in the modern Conservative party. Not least the cheers that greeted his arrival from the same MPs who had spent much of the past few weeks trying to get rid of him.The Convict opened up by saying he couldn’t understand why Labour had tabled the confidence debate. The Speaker had to gently point out to him that it was the government’s own motion. Johnson waved him away – details have never been his strong point and he wasn’t about to change now – and went on to deliver what was, even by his own standards, one of his more shambolic speeches. Up there with Peppa Pig in its chaotic delusion. Almost as if he were still hung over from the previous day’s Chequers’ party as he went into a Biggles extended air force metaphor.Vain fantasies. Tilting at windmills like some latter day Don Quixote. Only one utterly without honour. Unaware he was building his own monument to hubris, he spoke of his time in office as a series of ever greater triumphs. A showreel of greatest hits reframed by narcissistic denial. By achieving far less than other governments he had proved his dynamism. He had got all the big calls right. Even in the face of final judgment, he was unable to tell the truth. There was nothing on food banks, inflation, energy prices, poverty or the collapse of public services. All we had were past glories. His 2019 election success and a Brexit that’s still far from done.“I am proud of my leadership,” he concluded. Really? The lies, the parties, the cover-ups? Keir Starmer tried to gently point out to Johnson that he was leaving in disgrace. Most of his ministers and countless backbenchers had refused to serve under him. He was simply too corrupt. It wasn’t Labour who had forced him out, but his own party. He had finally overstepped the mark among MPs with a high threshold for sleaze. Rather than boasting, waiting for a card that is so high and wild he’ll never need to deal another, he should have been making an apology. Not just to the Tories but to the country.But the Convict wasn’t listening. He sat sour-faced, arms crossed in front of him as Nad shouted abuse at Starmer. She too is allergic to the truth. As soon as indecently possible, Johnson scuttled to the exit. Let’s hope we never see his like again.",

Twenty years patient.”Halftime review – Jennifer Lopez reveals far more than she thinks she did Read moreA link to the site, accompanying a photograph of Lopez in bed wearing a wedding band, also said: “We are so grateful to have that in abundance, a new wonderful family of five amazing children and a life that we have never had more reason to look forward to.”Sadie! #iykyk Go to https://t.co/G5oGxtX0z5 for all the deets. pic.twitter.com/yyxaCaKRbg— jlo (@JLo) July 17, 2022\nThey barely made the chapel by midnight, Lopez said, adding that the venue “graciously” stayed open late for the couple who took photos in a pink Cadillac convertible “once used by the King himself”.Now renamed Lopez Affleck, the 52-year-old recently released the Netflix documentary Halftime about the Super Bowl half-time show she co-headlined with Shakira in 2020. Affleck, 49, is known for his performances in the 2014 film Gone Girl and in 2012’s Argo, which he also directed.‘It’s like young love with the brakes off’: Bennifer and the couples who get back togetherRead moreThe couple famously dated in the early 2000s before rekindling their romance last year. They were co-stars in Gigli (2003) and Jersey Girl (2004) around the time they became engaged – but broke it off blaming “excessive media attention”.Lopez wrote on the celebrity news site Page Six in 2014: “Ben and I split up at the moment when I thought we were committing to each other forever, it was my first real heartbreak, it felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest.”In April the couple announced their engagement when Lopez shared a video of her large green-stoned engagement ring on her platform, a relationship revival which spurred an internet obsession over the couple that first began dating in July 2002.Thank God for Bennifer, a much-needed respite | Hadley FreemanRead moreAffleck was previously married to the actor Jennifer Garner, with whom he shares three children. They divorced in 2018 after 13 years of marriage. The marriage is Lopez’s fourth, having previously married singer Marc Anthony for 10 years, with whom she shares twins.Speaking of rekindling their relationship nearly 18 years after they split, Lopez told Ellen DeGeneres: “I don’t think anyone was more surprised than us.” She added: “It’s a beautiful thing.”Affleck has yet to comment publicly. In December 2021 he told the Wall Street Journal, “One of the harder lessons that I have learned is that it’s not wise to share everything with the world.”",
  "Except for a single, barely perceptible flinch, this would’ve been a Perfect 10 for the US track and field team.As it ended up, the Americans still won nine medals on home turf on Sunday at the world championships in what will go down as one of the most memorable days for the red, white and blue in its long, successful history. It was the best single medal day for a nation at the worlds, according to organizers.Devon Allen’s false start kept the US from a possible sweep in the 110m hurdles final and what could’ve been the 10th medal of the day. He will now take his talents to the NFL, where he’ll attempt to make the roster for the Philadelphia Eagles. It was hardly the way he wanted to finish at worlds.Fraser-Pryce wins 100m world title at 35 as Asher-Smith misses medalRead more“Track and field is so difficult because you train the whole year for one competition that lasts 12, 13 seconds and that’s that,” said the 27-year-old, whose training camp with the Eagles starts on 26 July. “I’ll learn from it and I’ll make sure I just react not as fast next time.”Allen’s disappointment hardly spoiled a day in which the recording of the Star-Spangled Banner got worn out. It began with the hammer throw, where Brooke Andersen took gold and Janee’ Kassanavoid won bronze.That was a warmup act for the night session, where seven medals piled up in a span of 10 minutes.The women’s pole vaulters led the run with Katie Nageotte and Sandi Morris finishing 1-2. Moments later – and following a delay as Allen unsuccessfully pleaded his case to remain in the race – Grant Holloway defended his hurdles title, with Trey Cunningham close behind in second.Around the same time, the US shot putters wrapped up a podium sweep with two-time Olympic champion Ryan Crouser taking gold, Joe Kovacs earning silver and Josh Awotunde finishing with bronze.All this came an evening after Fred Kerley, Marvin Bracy and Trayvon Bromell swept the men’s 100m. It got Crouser thinking of what was possible in his event.“My heart rate was probably like at 120, 130,” he said of watching the men’s 100m. “I probably shouldn’t have watched it because I had trouble calming back down. I had to make a mental note to take a few deep breaths and be like, ‘I don’t have to compete right now.’ Awesome to see Team USA sweep.”With their big-medal haul on Sunday, the Americans now have six golds and 14 total medals. The next most is three medals each by Ethiopia, Poland, China and Jamaica, who swept the women’s 100 to close out the night.“It says how amazing it is being on home soil and at Hayward Field,” Nageotte said of the show turned in by the Americans. “‘Hayward Magic’ is real ... Just seeing how many people were qualifying for semis, and then for finals, and then medaling, you watch it and it’s inspiring.”Allen seemed like a lock to add to the medal run. But he left too fast according to the sensors. His reaction time was 0.099 in the final, which earned him the red card. It was only a fraction less than his reaction time in the semi-final round, which was 0.101. But rules are rules and a reaction time – measured by sensors in the starting pistol and on the blocks – of less than 0.1 is considered a false start.“It’s track and field anything can happen,” Holloway said. “My hat goes off to Devon. Didn’t want to send him out like that but it is what it is.”Allen said this will make him more “hungry” for success on the football field and the track.“My goal is to be the best hurdler ever and I still have a chance to do that,” said Allen, who was a track standout and football player at the University of Oregon. “My goal is to play in the NFL and help the Eagles win a Super Bowl.”",
  "\n\nThe race for the Women’s Euro 2022 Golden Boot will be fascinating, with so many great goalscorers taking part in England.Norway’s Ada Hegerberg will be one of the favourites, having returned to the international fold after a five-year absence while her Scandinavian colleagues Pernille Harder (Denmark) and Stina Blackstenius (Sweden) are also in with a shout.The hosts could rely on the goals of Ellen White and Beth Mead among others to go far in the tournament, while Lauren Hemp is expected to be high in the table for assists.Other names to look out for are the Netherlands’ Vivianne Miedema, France’s Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Germany’s Alexandra Popp, with Spain’s Clàudia Pina an outside bet.

  "Can we talk about it now? I mean the subject most of the media and most of the political class has been avoiding for so long. You know, the only subject that ultimately counts – the survival of life on Earth. Everyone knows, however carefully they avoid the topic, that, beside it, all the topics filling the front pages and obsessing the pundits are dust. Even the Times editors still publishing columns denying climate science know it. Even the candidates for the Tory leadership, ignoring or downplaying the issue, know it. Never has a silence been so loud or so resonant.This is not a passive silence. It is an active silence, a fierce commitment to distraction and irrelevance in the face of an existential crisis. It is a void assiduously filled with trivia and amusement, gossip and spectacle. Talk about anything, but not about this. But while the people who dominate the means of communication frantically avoid the subject, the planet speaks, in a roar becoming impossible to ignore. These days of atmospheric rage, these heatshocks and wildfires ignore the angry shushing and burst rudely into our silent retreat.We have seen nothing yet. The dangerous heat England is suffering at the moment is already becoming normal in southern Europe, and would be counted among the cooler days during hot periods in parts of the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, where heat is becoming a regular threat to life. It cannot now be long, unless immediate and comprehensive measures are taken, before these days of rage become the norm even in our once-temperate climatic zone.The same formula applies to every harm humans do to each other: what cannot be discussed cannot be addressed. Our failure to prevent catastrophic global heating arises above all from the conspiracy of silence that dominates public life, the same conspiracy of silence that has, at one time or another, surrounded every variety of abuse and exploitation.We do not deserve this. The billionaire press and the politicians it promotes may deserve each other, but none of us deserves either group. They are constructing a world between them in which we have not elected to live, in which we may not be able to live. On this issue, as on so many, the people tend to be far ahead of those who claim to represent us. But those politicians and media barons deploy every imaginable wile and ruse to prevent decisive action from being taken.They do so on behalf of the fossil fuel industry, animal farming, finance, construction firms, car manufacturers and airline companies, but also on behalf of something bigger than any of those interests: the power of incumbency. Those who hold power today do so by stamping out challenges, regardless of the form they take. The demand to decarbonise our economies is not just a threat to carbon-intensive industry; it is a threat to the world order that permits powerful men to dominate us. To give ground to climate campaigners is to surrender power.Over the past few years, I’ve begun to see that mainstream environmental movements have made a terrible mistake. The theory of change pursued by most established green groups is entirely wrong. Though seldom openly articulated, it governs their strategy. It goes something like this. There is too little time and the ask is too big to try to change the system. People aren’t ready for it. We don’t want to scare away our members or provoke a fight with the government. So the only realistic approach is incrementalism. We will campaign, issue by issue, sector by sector, for gradual improvements. After years of persistence, the small asks will add up to the comprehensive change we seek and deliver the world we want.But while they have been playing patience, power has been playing poker. The radical right insurgency has swept all before it, crushing the administrative state, destroying public protections, capturing the courts, the electoral system and the infrastructure of government, shutting down the right to protest and the right to live. While we persuaded ourselves that there is no time for system change, they proved us wrong by changing everything.The terrifying truth: Britain’s a hothouse, but one day 40C will seem cool | Bill McGuireRead moreThe problem was never that system change is too big an ask or takes too long. The problem is that incrementalism is too small an ask. Not just too small to drive transformation; not just too small to stop the tidal wave of revolutionary change rolling in from the opposite direction; but also too small to break the conspiracy of silence. Only a demand for system change, directly confronting the power driving us to planetary destruction, has the potential to match the scale of the problem and to inspire and mobilise the millions of people required to generate effective action.All this time, environmentalists have been telling people we face an unprecedented, existential crisis, while simultaneously asking them to recycle their bottle tops and change their drinking straws. Green groups have treated their members like idiots and, I suspect, somewhere deep down, the members know it. Their timidity, their reluctance to say what they really want, their mistaken belief that people aren’t ready to hear anything more challenging than this micro-consumerist bollocks carries a significant share of the blame for global failure.The terrifying truth: Britain’s a hothouse, but one day 40C will seem cool | Bill McGuireRead moreThere was never time for incrementalism. Far from being a shortcut to the change we want to see, it is a morass in which ambition sinks. System change, as the right has proved, is, and has always been, the only fast and effective means of transformation.Some of us know what we want: private sufficiency, public luxury, doughnut economics, participatory democracy and an ecological civilisation. None of these are bigger asks than those the billionaire press has made and largely achieved: the neoliberal revolution that has swept away effective governance, effective taxation of the rich, effective restraints on the power of business and oligarchs and, increasingly, effective democracy.So let’s break our own silence. Let’s stop lying to ourselves and others by pretending that small measures deliver major change. Let’s abandon the timidity and tokenism. Let’s stop bringing buckets of water when only fire engines will do. Let’s build our campaign for systemic change towards the critical 25% threshold of public acceptance, beyond which, a range of scientific studies suggests, social tipping happens.I feel clearer about what effective political action looks like than I have ever done. But a major question remains. Given that we have left it so late, can we reach the social tipping point before we hit the environmental tipping point?\nGeorge Monbiot is a Guardian columnist\n",
  "For more than a month, Vasyl has been commuting from his home town in Ukraine’s east to the frontline, about an hour away.In April, the hotel owner from Konstantinovka said the situation was “completely fucked”, with Russian artillery fire bombarding his unit incessantly. Now, he looked visibly different: thinner and worn out but still motivated.“Our brigade is more than half people from the Donbas,” said Vasyl, of the eastern region that pro-Russian forces have been fighting for on and off since 2014, and which is now facing the brunt of Moscow’s full-scale invasion.A school in Konstantinovka that was hit by a rocket. Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianFor Vasyl and many in his unit, winning or losing is not in the abstract. If the frontlines move further west, he stands to lose everything: his hotel, his house, his home town and the people he knows.For the last eight years, he said that he and others like him have watched life for people in Russian-occupied Donbas deteriorate drastically and that he will do anything he can to prevent more of the region from coming under occupation.No jobs, no money, no house: Ukrainians forced back to frontline townsRead moreRussia has declared that capturing the Donbas is one of its priorities and has been slowly bombarding and then capturing towns. It now holds about 75% of the region.Vasyl represents a contingent of people in the Donbas who are fighting for the area to remain part of Ukraine, either as soldiers, volunteers or as part of the local self-defence forces.The stereotype of people from Donbas is that they are pro-Russian and the existence of people like Vasyl and their supporters is rarely highlighted. While those interviewed said that there are still many people with pro-Russian views, they also said that a lot has changed and that it is a mistake to assume those with pro-Russian views are the majority.In Bakhmut, a frontline town in the Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk region, Viktor Shulik, a former headteacher, and his 23-year-old son Denys Shulik, who taught physical education at the same school, stand under the shade of a tree carrying rifles. They had just walked four kilometres through the wheat fields from their positions on the frontlines.Viktor Shulik. Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianViktor and Denys are from Popasna, a town in Luhansk region that was on the 2014-22 eastern frontlines and was occupied by Russian forces in May. Images of the town show that it has been almost flattened by shelling.This is Popasna, a Ukrainian city in the Luhansk region, taken by the Russian troops. What had once been a safe home for many is now destroyed to the ground. And it's not just this town. Remember Mariupol, Bucha, Irpin. pic.twitter.com/vbfsaiDXsA— Franak Viačorka (@franakviacorka) June 10, 2022\n“War is not new to us but this is the war of wars,” said Viktor. “People need to understand that they have come here to destroy us. It is a cycle of history.”After their kitchen windows blew in, they went to stay with friends in another Donetsk town, Lyman, which like Popasna was eventually occupied by Russian forces in May. Lyman was also being bombarded and Viktor and Denys decided to sign up.“We don’t have an apartment now, our block was set on fire by a missile, so we’re now homeless people. We don’t have the school any more because it was bombed and so we don’t have a place of work,” said Viktor. “We took up arms because, well, what else can we do?”“They said we wouldn’t be able to stay together if we enlisted because I have military experience and he doesn’t and I’m old and he’s young, so we decided to join the territorial army instead,” said Viktor.In 2014, half of the Donbas was occupied by Russia’s proxy forces after a coordinated propaganda campaign and military operation that drew support from some of the local population.The takeover was led mostly by people connected to Russian military intelligence but also involved locals. After a series of battles in the first year, the frontlines remained almost stagnant from the end of 2015 until 2022. The fighting was low level compared with the current war, with shells being hurled between the two sides infrequently.As part of the peace agreements brokered in 2015, Russia demanded that Ukraine allow the so-called republic’s representatives into Ukraine’s parliament. Ukraine refused, arguing that it would give Russia a direct say on Ukraine’s national and foreign policy.The agreements were never implemented, and the Donbas region went from a vast industrial region in need of modernisation into a region deemed to have little to no future.In occupied Donbas, the isolated economy plummeted and civil liberties vanished. Anyone who complained or went against the regime could be held without trial in detention camps, disappear, or be even executed.Meanwhile, the war in the Donbas was gradually ignored by many in Ukraine, who were able to carry on their lives as normal, far from the frontlines. Those living in the Donbas on the Ukraine-controlled side, however, still felt it, from bursts of shelling to unemployment, being physically separated from friends and relatives and problems with basic services such as water, electricity and gas caused by the demarcation line.Since the full-scale invasion, some have returned to fight in the Donbas with feelings of guilt. One of them is Yegor Firsov. Originally from Donetsk, Firsov became an MP in Ukraine’s post-2014 parliament in Kyiv and later an environmental activist. He is now a volunteer medic for the army.“For the last eight years, I lived in Kyiv. I ignored the war. I had a gun in my house for eight years and I never practised how to put it together. I resent myself because (of it),” said Firsov, who is from Avdiivka, a town still held by Ukraine that has been largely destroyed by shelling since the February invasion.Firsov said he signed up for Kyiv’s territorial defence forces, and after witnessing the aftermath of Russia’s atrocities in Kyiv region, he wanted to join the army. He knew the commanders from Avdiivka and spent a month training as a medic before being deployed.A Ukrainian serviceman with the nom de guerre Medvid. Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“People think the Donbas is exclusively pro-Russian people but there are lots of people who are against Russia and patriotic,” said Firsov. “People from the rest of Ukraine understand people in Donbas now. This war wasn’t their choice. For example, the (displaced person) question was always about the Donbas and now they are from everywhere.”Many other Donbas natives have been fighting since 2014. Medvid, a Ukrainian special forces soldier who likes to be known by his nom de guerre, said he understood Russia from the inside.“I was in Moscow when it all started [in 2014]. I had a good metal business there,” said Medvid. “But I was watching the TV and thinking what the hell is going on.”He said that his unit was made up mostly of Donbas locals, aged 21 to late 50s, and that their former commander had been 62.Putin toilet paper at the office of Tetiana Khimion, a dance teacher in Sloviansk who has been organising supplies of basic equipment for units in northern Donetsk. Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianNear the frontlines, Tetiana Khimion, a dance teacher in Sloviansk, has been organising supplies of basic equipment for units in northern Donetsk, where her husband is fighting.“I used to have a great life. I had dozens of students, I could afford everything I needed, I had the person I loved sleeping next to me,” said Khimion, in her office where nearby streets have come under intense shelling in recent weeks.Her and other volunteers in the town fill holes in the army supply chain – sleeping mats, rucksacks, socks, boots, helmets.“Unfortunately, a lot of effort was put in over a long time to erase Ukrainian-ness in the Donbas,” said Khimion. “So, I don’t deny that there are a lot of people who are pro-Russian. But it all comes from the Soviet legacy.“Then there are other people who are indifferent because their houses are somewhere away from this,” said Khimion.“The one thing people must not do is forget about the war like last time,” said Khimion. “I often think if more people had cared before, things would be different now.” This article was amended on 18 July 2022 to correct the spelling of Tetiana Khimion’s surname.",
  "Libya’s prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, has made an unexpected alliance with his former enemy, the eastern warlord Khalifa Haftar, in a bid to cement a fragile ceasefire and end a months-long oil blockade.Less than three years ago, Haftar’s self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) besieged Tripoli in a failed attempt to capture the capital. On Monday, in a highly symbolic gesture, LNA’s chief of staff, Abdulrazek al-Nadoori, was invited to visit the city for talks.The prospect of Dbeibeh and Haftar burying their differences may be welcomed by the United Nations as it struggles to maintain a ceasefire that ended a six-year civil war in 2020.Dbeibeh had already made a powerful gesture to Haftar’s supporters, with his sacking last week of the director of the state-owned National Oil Corporation, Mustafa Sanalla.Sanalla had been at odds with pro-Haftar protesters who had been blockading eastern oil ports for months, sending oil exports into a downward spiral. Those protests ended within hours of Sanalla’s removal, raising the prospect of Libya returning to full oil production.Western governments will be happy with the return of Libyan oil to a constricted world market, but some will balk at the enhanced role for Haftar.The 78-year-old general is a polarising figure. He is popular in the east for his campaign against anarchic militias, but his enemies accuse him of war crimes during the siege of Tripoli.US accuses Russia of exploiting conflict in LibyaRead moreLondon and Washington are also concerned about Haftar’s closeness to Russia, which supports him with mercenaries from the Kremlin-backed Wagner group.“The Americans and the British had been following a policy where Haftar must be contained, because of his links with Russia,” said Mohamed Eljarh, director of Libya Desk, a risk consultancy. “They had supported Dbeibeh as a shield against Haftar, but now he’s done a deal with Haftar.”Meanwhile, Dbeibeh’s takeover of the national oil corporation is controversial. When the existing chairman refused to be sacked, Dbeibeh sent troops to occupy the building on Thursday and force him out. Many are unhappy with Sanalla’s replacement, Farhat Bengdara, a former central bank chief during Muammar Gaddafi’s dictatorship.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTBengdara, for his part, has promised transparency for the NOC, coupled with a hefty pay rise for oil workers.The use of troops to take control of NOC headquarters has also made oil analysts nervous. “The crude markets will welcome the stability with the reopening of Libya’s oil ports,” said Mark Rossano, chief executive of investment advisor Capital Holdings. “However, concern remains about how long this pause in protests and in-fighting will last.”Dbeibeh’s hold on power is precarious. Earlier this month, protests erupted in nine cities against corruption and power cuts. Dbeibeh was originally installed as a temporary prime minister to run the country until elections due last December. When those elections were cancelled, amid constitutional arguments, he decided to stay on, despite Libya’s parliament demanding he step down.",
  "Deleted Secret Service texts sent on 6 January, the day of the insurrection at the US Capitol, and the day before will be released by Tuesday to the House committee investigating the failed attempt by supporters of Donald Trump to overturn the 2020 presidential election result, a panel member said.“You can imagine how shocked we were to get the letter from the [Department of Homeland Security] inspector general saying that he had been trying to get this information and that they had, in fact, been deleted after he’d asked for them,” committee member and California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren told ABC’s This Week.“We need all the texts to get the full picture,” Lofgren added.The Secret Service’s account about how text messages from the day before and the day of the Capitol attack were erased has shifted several times, the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security told the House January 6 select committee at a briefing on Friday.At one point, the explanation from the Secret Service for the lost texts was because of software upgrades, the inspector general told the panel, while at another point, the explanation was because of device replacements.The inspector general also said that though the Secret Service opted to have his office do a review of the agency’s response to the Capitol attack in lieu of conducting after-action reports, it then stonewalled the review by slow-walking production of materials.After the inspector general raised his complaints, he then discussed the feasibility of reconstructing the texts. But the issues so alarmed the select committee that the panel moved hours later to subpoena the Secret Service, according to participants at the briefing.The string of fast-paced developments on Capitol Hill reflected how the erasure of the text messages – first disclosed in a letter to Congress by the inspector general, Joseph Cuffari – has become a top priority for the congressional inquiry into January 6.The circumstances surrounding the erasure of the Secret Service texts from the day before and the day of the Capitol attack have become central for the select committee as it investigates how it planned to move Donald Trump and Mike Pence as the violence unfolded.The texts are potentially significant for investigators as the Secret Service played a crucial role in preventing Donald Trump from going to the Capitol that day and wanted to remove then-vice-president Mike Pence from the complex, according to the panel.",
  "Russia’s Gazprom has told customers in Europe it cannot guarantee gas supplies because of “extraordinary” circumstances, according to a letter seen by Reuters, upping the ante in an economic tit-for-tat with the west over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.Dated 14 July, the letter from the Russian state gas monopoly said it was declaring force majeure on supplies, starting from 14 June.Known as an “act of God” clause, a force majeure clause is standard in business contracts and spells out extreme circumstances that excuse a party from their legal obligations.Gazprom had no immediate comment on the move.Uniper, Germany’s biggest importer of Russian gas, was among the customers who said it had received a letter, and that it had formally rejected the claim as unjustified. It did not share the letter, but a trading source, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the force majeure concerned supplies through the Nord Stream 1 (NS1) pipeline, a major supply route to Germany and beyond.Flows through the pipeline are at zero as the link undergoes annual maintenance that began on 11 July and is meant to conclude on Thursday.Europe fears Moscow could keep the pipeline mothballed in retaliation for sanctions imposed on Russia over the war in Ukraine, heightening an energy crisis that risks tipping the region in recession.Gazprom had already cut the pipeline’s capacity to 40% on 14 June, citing the delay of a turbine under maintenance work in Canada by the equipment supplier Siemens Energy.Canada sent the turbine for the Nord Stream gas pipeline to Germany by plane on Sunday after the repair work had been completed, Kommersant newspaper reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.Provided there are no problems with logistics and customs, it will take another five to seven days for the turbine to reach Russia, the report added.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTGermany’s economy ministry said on Monday it could not provide details of the turbine’s whereabouts. But a spokesperson said it was a replacement part that was meant to be used only from September, meaning its absence could not be the real reason for the fall-off in gas flows before the annual maintenance work on the pipeline.“This sounds like a first hint that the gas supplies via NS1 will possibly not resume after the 10-day maintenance has ended,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at the bank ABN Amro.“Depending on what ‘extraordinary’ circumstances [Gazprom] have in mind in order to declare the force majeure, and whether these issues are technical or more political, it could mean the next step in escalation between Russia and Europe-Germany,” he added.The Austrian oil and gas group OMV, however, said on Monday it expected gas deliveries from Russia through the pipeline to resume as planned after the stoppage.Russian gas supplies have been declining via major routes for some months, including those through Ukraine and Belarus as well as through Nord Stream 1 under the Baltic Sea.The European Union, which has imposed sanctions on Moscow, aims to stop using Russian fossil fuels by 2027 but wants supplies to continue for now as it develops alternative sources.For Moscow and for Gazprom, the energy flows are a vital revenue stream when western sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have strained Russian finances.According to the Russian finance ministry, the federal budget received 6.4tn roubles (£96bn) from oil and gas sales in the first half of the year. This is comparedwith planned 9.5tn roubles for the whole 2022.The grace period for payments on two of Gazprom’s international bonds expires on 19 July, and if foreign creditors are not paid by then the company will technically be in default.",
  "The greeting at the Utoro Peace Memorial Museum is impossible to miss. Emblazoned on a huge banner hanging on a wall, it says: “This is where we live. This is where we meet.” The message is simple, but there was a time when Utoro, a small neighbourhood near Kyoto in western Japan, was wracked by racism and division, inflamed by the legacy of war and colonialism.The museum is proof that two apparently irreconcilable communities – Japanese and ethnic Koreans – can come together to confront, and heal, the scars of history.Koreans have lived in Utoro since the second world war, when labourers were brought from the Korean peninsula to build an airfield. When construction work ended after Japan’s defeat in 1945, 1,300 Koreans found themselves abandoned in their ramshackle bunkhouses.Residents of Utoro after the second world war. Photograph: Utoro Peace Memorial MuseumBy the end of the war, which also ended Japan’s 35-year colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, more than 2 million Koreans were living in Japan. About two-thirds returned to the Korean peninsula, but hundreds of thousands remained, and would turn the zainichi – literally “living in Japan” – into a significant ethnic minority in a largely homogeneous country.Those who stayed in Utoro endured poor housing and sanitation, poverty and unemployment, and accusations that they were “illegally occupying” their 2ha district of the neighbourhood. Their homes lacked proper plumbing, forcing them to draw water from wells.Weeks before the museum opened in April came a reminder that hostility towards Japan’s large ethnic Korean population has yet to be consigned to the past.Utoro after the war. Photograph: K Nakayama/Utoro Peace Memorial MuseumShogo Arimoto, a 22-year-old man, pleaded guilty in May to an arson attack that destroyed or seriously damaged seven houses in Utoro and destroyed dozens of artefacts destined for the museum. The Kyoto district court last month sentenced him to four years in prison.Arimoto said his crime, committed in August last year, was designed to “intimidate and force out” Korean residents, whom he described as an “unacceptable presence” in the neighbourhood.Ku Ryang-ok, a third-generation resident of Utoro, told reporters: “To me, Utoro is my identity. Seeing the houses burned down is like being told that your presence is not needed, that you are in the way. It felt like I had been set on fire.”Akiko Tagawa, the museum’s Japanese director, said: “What he [Arimoto] did was unacceptable, but it wasn’t an isolated incident – it’s a sickness in Japanese society. But the museum is proof of how Koreans and Japanese can come together to protect their neighbourhood.”The arson attack was a reminder of Korean residents’ long struggle to establish their right to stay in Utoro. They came close to being forced out after a real estate developer ordered them to leave in the late 1980s, prompting a long legal battle.Their plight prompted an intervention from the UN committee on economic, social and cultural rights, which said it was ‘‘concerned about forced evictions, especially of the homeless from their temporary abode and those who have occupied houses for a long time in the Utoro district”.The residents won a reprieve a decade ago when the South Korean government and supporters in Japan raised enough money to buy some of the land, where public housing has been built to replace the remaining 80 residents’ ageing, crumbing homes.Traditional Korean music and dance at the opening ceremony of the museum in April. Photograph: K Nakayama/Utoro Peace Memorial Museum‘Far right becoming louder’While anti-Korean groups have become a less visible presence on city streets in recent years, there has been a disturbing rise in online hate speech, according to Jinwoong Kwak, the joint representative of the Utoro Private Fund.“The voices of the Japanese far right are becoming louder, and there is a movement to deny the truth of history,” he said, referring to conservative politicians and activists who insist that Japan did not use sex slaves – known as comfort women – and forced labourers from the Korean peninsula before and during the war.“They’re becoming very aggressive about denying Japan’s wartime actions, and you can see that in hate speech and hate crimes in Utoro and other places throughout Japan,” Kwak said. “This was clearly a hate crime.”Garbage island no more: how one Japanese community triumphed over a toxic waste dumpRead moreThe rise in anti-Korean sentiment prompted Japan’s government to introduce a law banning hate speech in 2016. But critics say the law lacks teeth, as violators do not face punishment. Only Kawasaki, a city near Tokyo with a large Korean community, has made hate speech a criminal offence, punishable by a fine of up to ¥500,000 ($3,690).“Japan has ratified international conventions on the elimination of racism, so it needs to have appropriate punishments for hate speech,” said Shiki Tomimasu, a lawyer who is representing the victims of last year’s arson attack.‘Taking courage from their identity’Tagawa, who moved to Utoro 40 years ago, has mixed feelings about the new housing, which will be completed next year. “It means part of the community and their history will disappear – some might even want to pretend they never existed,” she said.But the museum, she added, will ensure that the first generation of Koreans in Utoro – the last of whom died in November – will never be forgotten.“Koreans who visit the museum say they feel proud and take courage from their identity. And Japanese people who knew nothing about Utoro say they’re learning for the first time about how local people struggled against discrimination. And how they survived.”",
  "In this day and age, it has become common for movie stars to develop their own little side hustles. Gwyneth Paltrow, for instance, has Goop, and Rob Lowe has a podcast. And then there is Terrence Howard. Terrence Howard’s side hustle is developing a new hydrogen technology to help defend the sovereignty of Uganda.It almost feels like a shame to back this up with anything as ugly as details, but here goes. Last week, the actor, singer and aborted War Machine Terrence Howard was invited by Uganda’s agriculture minister Frank Tumwebaze to give an address to help attract investment from people in the Ugandan diaspora.This in itself is fairly common. Getting a famous person to say some blandly inoffensive things about a subject or issue has long been part of the awareness-raising toolkit. However, this time there was a problem. The problem was that Terrence Howard doesn’t do blandly inoffensive. No, Terrence Howard only does impenetrably batshit.“I went out to explore a new way of understanding how the universe works,” he told the crowd in a video that was quickly shared by UBC Uganda. “I was able to define the grand unified field equation they’ve been looking for, and put it into geometry. What I am saying is that we have invented a new form of flight that I would like to bring here to Uganda to replace the drones, to replace the helicopters, to replace the planes … This is the geometry of hydrogen”.On and on he went, somehow managing to cram several decades’ worth of gobbledygook into two short minutes. He talked about his new drone system, the Lynchpin, that can apparently use unlimited hydrogen bonding and super-symmetry in order to form swarming colonies that can defend countries and remove plastics from the ocean.Now, obviously this sounds wonderful, because who doesn’t want to have safer borders and cleaner seas backed by the power of super-symmetry? So I Googled “Super Symmetry” and found a website called Super Symmetrical Systems, which does little but blather on about how humanity’s purpose “was deliberately branded into our genetic code. Like a sub-atomic, interwoven prime directive for us to search for the Greater Truth, to recall lost echoes of conversations from the past and to reveal that which has never been uncovered”.So I started clicking around, and found a link on the site called “Terry on Wave Fields”. This took me to the site where Terrence Howard explains his infamous (and arguably inaccurate) claim that one multiplied by one equals two. It contains one video entitled “Terrence proves gravity is an effect not a cause”, captioned by an explanation for phenomena such as “hyperbolic geometric inertial systems” and “Non-Euclidean chiral asymmetries of force in motion”. It also contains another video, of Terrence Howard singing the second song from an album he released in 2008.Anyway, long story short, I am now convinced that Terrence Howard is the cleverest man in the universe. He has to be, surely. Because I don’t understand a single thing that he says. And, by all accounts, nor does anyone else.Underneath the UBC tweet, you will find scores of people all painfully unsure of how to react to his solution of the unified field equation. All the coverage it received, far from luring the diaspora’s money to Uganda, only really achieves a kind of stunned inability to process anything. Even the people around Howard in the clip start to look actively uncomfortable the more he keeps talking, the same way you do when you realise you’re too far into a conversation with a Jehovah’s Witness to politely back out.Oh fine, listen, one of two things is going to happen here. Either Terrence Howard has gone bananas, and reacted to the disintegration of his personal reputation (he has been accused of domestic abuse multiple times) by falling into a hole of obscure mathematics that will ensure he is never taken seriously again. Or he is right, and will one day have an army of weaponised super-symmetrical murder drones at his solitary disposal. And I don’t exactly want to get on his bad side if that happens, so you’ll excuse me for sitting on the fence.",
  "It was the moment Dani Mathisen had eagerly awaited for weeks. She and her husband watched the ultrasound screen as the wand slicked through the jelly on her stomach. As a doctor, Dani could interpret the images on the 20-week week anatomy scan herself – and immediately, she started seeing the problems in her pregnancy.Her daughter’s feet weren’t forming quite right. A bone surgery can fix that, she thought.There was only one kidney. But you only need one kidney.A little bubble at the base of the spine indicated neural tube defects. A neurosurgeon could fix that. Scoliosis curved the spine itself. An orthopedic surgeon could fix that.And then they got to the brain. It had never developed; there were no identifiable structures.A surgeon can’t fix that, she thought, soaked in sorrow. No one can fix that.Dani had always wanted to be two things in life: a good doctor and a good mother. Both goals seemed to be on track. She was finishing up med school, and she and her husband bought a house with an extra bedroom that would be perfect for the nursery. They called their growing fetus Mini.But looking at the ultrasound images, she knew that being a good doctor and a good mom meant terminating the pregnancy.Dani lived in Texas, though, where abortions were banned after six weeks starting in September – the same month she had her ultrasound. She was finally able to book an appointment in another state, with a doctor she’d never met before. Her husband wasn’t allowed in the clinic with her because of Covid restrictions, and she couldn’t keep her phone with her. The procedure took 14 hours.After her experience, Dani, a lifelong Texan, moved far from home to do her medical residency in a state where abortion rights are protected – partly in case she ever needs care like this again, but more importantly so that she can become a “full, rounded ob-gyn that has every single tool in her arsenal”, she said. The reversal of reproductive rights by the US supreme court in June only reinforced the decision.Abortion bans first and foremost affect pregnant people who need care. But bans proliferating through US states will also reverberate through an entire generation of healthcare professionals.“It’s going to change the way that medicine is practiced,” said Kavita Vinekar, assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and coauthor of a study on how restricting abortion affects medical training. Instead of offering care based on “clinical decision-making, sound evidence, and the body of knowledge that we have in medicine, we’re going to be forced to function in an environment that’s really wrought with confusion and fear”.Learning about abortion care is not required in US med schools, but some programs offer lectures or opportunities to shadow clinicians. Ob-gyn residency programs are the only ones required, by a national accreditation council, to train doctors on abortion care – including procedures, counseling, and the management of complications – though residents may opt out of performing the procedures if they choose. Ob-gyn residency programs in states with abortion bans may need to offer out-of-state training options or alternative training in order to maintain their accredited status, according to guidelines that are being updated after the supreme court decision.You’re going to raise a generation of ob-gyns who have had no exposure to these kinds of procedures at allDanielle Jones“You’re going to raise a generation of ob-gyns who have had no exposure to these kinds of procedures at all,” said Danielle Jones, an ob-gyn and science communicator who trained and lived most of her life in Texas before leaving the state about six months ago.Physicians who don’t feel capable or confident in their ability to offer abortion care may see their skills limited in other areas of care as well. “A lot of what we learn in abortion care extends far beyond abortion care,” Vinekar said. Many of the procedures are the same for other reproductive health complications, such as miscarriage management or uterine evacuations. “Those are all situations that come up whether or not you have legal abortion in your state, and physicians need to be well-trained and able to address these sometimes emergent scenarios.”In states with abortion bans, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) “will be working with those states specifically to address and ensure adequate training”, said co-chief executive officer, Dr Maureen Phipps, in a press briefing about the Dobbs decision. But, she cautioned, “it’s not straightforward. We are going to have to do a lot of work to ensure that training.” The organization will also offer resources and answer individual questions from members about the patchwork of state laws, she said.The Biden administration recently pledged to protect the right to abortion when a patient’s life is at risk. But pregnancy, especially in the US, is already extremely dangerous. Doctors fear an environment where they need to wait for patients to be at death’s door before providing them the treatment they need – especially if they need to seek authorization in situations where a few minutes can mean the difference between life and death.In Texas, Dani saw how close pregnant patients needed to be to death before a doctor could intervene. On her med school rotations, she would see patients with dangerously high blood pressure – putting them at risk for strokes and neurological damage – or who were clearly developing sepsis, a life-threatening infection, but whose doctors were required to wait until their conditions worsened before terminating the pregnancy.“You know the bad things that can happen, and you just have to sit and wait until it’s bad enough? That’s horrible,” Dani said. “To me, that goes against ‘do no harm’ because it’s happening – the harm is happening. It’s just not harmful enough.”Staying pregnant herself would have opened up Dani to potential harm, while the outcome for Mini would have been the same no matter what happened. All Dani could do was ease the suffering.An undeveloped brain meant the baby would die before delivery or soon after birth, because there would be no respiratory drive prompting her to breathe. If Mini survived childbirth, she would slowly suffocate to death – and there was no way to save her.“It wasn’t really a decision because no one would choose to have their child live and die like that. It would have been a very painful death where she eventually just runs out of oxygen,” Dani said.And watching Mini die would have made it difficult or impossible for Dani to work as a doctor. “I don’t think I would have been able to go back into medicine after watching my child die,” she said. “I would not be able to relive that every time.”Doctors forced to watch patients enduring such danger and trauma are going to struggle with plummeting morale and burnout, Vinekar said.“I can think of nothing more likely to drive people out of healthcare because of that powerlessness,” Vinekar said. “The reason we’re in this field is to help people.” But “forcing people to incur the risk of pregnancy against their will is perhaps one of the most inhumane things you can do”.",
  "It was the family secret that nearly went to the grave. Gerrit Jongsma was a convicted war criminal – a small-town mayor and Nazi collaborator who sent at least one Jewish family to their deaths. He was also the great-grandfather of Eline Jongsma, a Dutch writer and film director, who only discovered his identity a decade ago.Far from further hiding his crimes, Jongsma, with long-term directing partner, Kel O’Neill, created a documentary about her relative, which was released on Instagram this month.His Name is My Name recounts Eline Jongsma’s efforts to trace the life and crimes of her great-grandfather from fragments in the national archives while weaving in her own childhood memories, both happy and painful.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

There are 10 episodes, each a self-contained story of two or three minutes. The directors imagine their audience might catch an episode at bus stops or train stations. They have avoided the conventions of second world war film-making, using animation rather than photography, vivid colours and an ethereal synth soundtrack rather than archival footage.“We had a rule right out of the gate – no black and white, and no violins,” said O’Neill.The directors used animation rather than photography, vivid colours and an ethereal synth soundtrack rather than archival footage. Photograph: Jongsma + O’Neill/Jure BrglezAt the root of the work is Gerrit Jongsma and the dark shadow he cast over his descendants. A customs officer in Rotterdam, Jongsma was a member of the NSB, the Dutch fascist party with a dark fantasy of creating a Greater Netherlands empire encompassing a swathe of Africa, the Dutch East Indies and Flanders in Belgium.After the Nazis overran the Netherlands in May 1940, the NSB became their most loyal lieutenants. They were soon rewarded. Jongsma, known as Gekke Gerrit (Crazy Gerrit), was appointed mayor of the town of Krommennie, north of Amsterdam. He used his position to embezzle town funds and punish people for infractions, such as having a radio or evading the draft. After a tip-off, he ordered a raid on an attic above a barber’s shop, where a Jewish couple, Esther and Benjamin Drilsma, were hiding. He then ordered a hunt for their six-year-old daughter Fien (Adolphine), who was sequestered elsewhere. The family were briefly reunited in a transit camp, but then parted again. Esther and Benjamin Drilsma were murdered at Auschwitz in 1943. Fien was murdered at Sobibor soon after.While Jongsma says she has gained some professional distance from the year of film-making, this unusually personal project has been strange and unsettling. “As a film-maker and someone who thinks this is an important story, I want the widest audience possible,” she said. “On the other hand, I really don’t want to tell the story. Part of me just wants to hide away.” Some relatives have been uneasy about the project: “There was definitely some fear that I would tarnish the family,” she said.The directors wanted to retell a history of the second world war for a new generation. Photograph: Jongsma + O’Neill/Jure BrglezBoth directors wanted to uncover the story of wartime collaboration, but also retell a history of the second world war for a new generation, partly inspired by their experience of living in Donald Trump’s America. “We’ve really seen populism rise very quickly there,” said Jongsma, who lived in the US for 20 years, while O’Neill is from Massachusetts and New York. “Those four years of Trump in the United States were very much on our minds as we went into this.”O’Neill had the sense of history “start[ing] to disappear” and become less engaging for a younger audience. “These war traumas last a generation,” said O’Neill, whose parents served in the Vietnam war. “And I think the less that these things are talked about, the more they sort of fester and pop up in ways they’re unexpected in family dynamics.”The film-makers got their chance via a commission to explore the perpetrators of war crimes from the memorial centres attached to three Nazi-era camps: Falstad in Norway, Bergen-Belsen in Germany and Westerbork in the Netherlands.Eline Jongsma has a personal connection to Westerbork, once a Nazi transit camp that was the last staging post for more than 100,000 Dutch Jews who were put on trains and murdered in concentration camps. She grew up near the forests and fields of the camp. She recalls family hikes where they went “foraging for mushrooms in haunted soil”, as O’Neill puts it. Now, those trips have become another thread woven into their evocative and haunting documentary.",
  "After years of division, the unexpected sudden arrival of unity should be cause for celebration. It has long been accepted by the government’s opponents that 12 years of Tory rule have been a disastrous combination of stagnation and decline, so it is to be welcomed that pretenders to the Conservative crown have now embraced these facts.That Liz Truss has savaged the economic policies of the government she has served in since 2019 is notable enough, damning Rishi Sunak for plunging the country into a coming recession. But Truss’s critique is far more sweeping than that, damning “business-as-usual economic management, which has delivered low growth for decades”. Whether Truss is aware of this or not – she did, after all, get lost leaving the room during her campaign launch – this is a timeframe that includes the last three Conservative prime ministers. And she is on point: the average economic growth of the 2010s was only marginally better than the 2000s, itself the worst decade for growth since the war.This is an important concession, because when he was steward of the British economy, George Osborne defended his slash-and-burn austerity on the grounds that “truly sustainable growth … depends on sound public finances.” But these cuts delivered only stagnation, because they suppressed tax receipts. The vandalism went further: a lack of investment in infrastructure and skills left a legacy of lower potential growth even after Osborne’s political downfall.But Truss’s critique goes further. We would expect her to assail New Labour’s time in office, but by “decades” she surely goes beyond 1997, and she would be correct. After all, the average economic growth under Thatcherism in the 80s was 2.6%, the same as the much-maligned 70s, when western economies were convulsed by a massive oil price shock and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system.The key difference between those two decades, of course, was that the proceeds of growth were more equitably distributed in the 70s. It turns out that Truss is a comrade: she is apparently savaging the neoliberal economic settlement of weak trade unions, privatisation and low tax on the rich. And she would be right: after all, in the period when unions were strong, big businesses were expected to contribute more and state intervention in the economy was widespread – the 50s and 60s – growth was much higher.In the 1950s, for example, growth averaged 3.2%: for those ascribing that to rebuilding a nation reduced to rubble by the Luftwaffe, our industrial production had recovered to prewar levels by 1947, and growth was even higher in the 1960s. It may not be her intent, but Truss’s disavowal of decades of stagnation represents a repudiation of the Thatcherite religion.For doomed candidate Tom Tugendhat, alarm at the potential consequences of damning Tory economics began to creep in: “It’s very difficult to understand who’s disowning and who’s defending the record of the last few years that they’ve been in government,” he cries. But Tugendhat is not one to shy away from the ruinous consequences of Tory policies, either. “We need to build more new homes,” he says sagely. “That’s the solution to the housing crisis.” Quite so, Tugendhat – as the House Builders Federation told MPs recently: “In the years following the financial crisis, net additions to the housing stock fell to 124,000 new homes per annum, the lowest peacetime figure ever recorded.” At the sharpest end of this wholly artificially manufactured crisis, one in 206 citizens of a supposedly wealthy society, England, are homeless, while one in five children live in a house that is either overcrowded, unaffordable or unsuitable, or a combination of these ills. The housing crisis spurs on many evil spin-offs: it damages mental and physical health, increasing the risk of respiratory illnesses such as asthma, and damages the educational attainment of children. With English private renters coughing up nearly a quarter of their income on rents – in London it’s closer to half – here is a cost of living crisis convulsing households long before Tories were forced to wring their hands about it. And again, Tugendhat might rightly protest that New Labour’s housebuilding record was miserable, too: and he’d be right that a dogma that satisfying this basic human need must be left to the market has taken hold of both political parties.It may seem like an eccentric act of self-harm for Tories to capitulate to the fiery critiques long made of their time in office, but there is perhaps a logic to it. Boris Johnson, after all, was allowed to get away with the deceit that he represented a change, a rupture, from what came before him, despite repeatedly voting for policies that inflicted so much harm on the economic and social fabric of the nation. But in these febrile times, the Tories’ opponents should finally rejoice. A consensus has finally been established that Conservative rule has been a travesty, a miserable tale of squashed potential and stolen dreams. Don’t take my word for it: there is finally cross-party unity, and we have the Tory truth tellers to thank for it.\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist\n",
  "Tory leadership candidates will have to demonstrate on Monday that they support not only the net zero target but a programme of action to fulfil the goal, the leading climate voice in the cabinet has said.Alok Sharma, the UK cabinet minister who led last year’s Cop26 UN climate summit, will ask each of the five remaining candidates to prove their climate credentials when he chairs green hustings on Monday afternoon in Westminster.Temperatures are expected to soar as high as 42C (107F) in the UK on Monday, with a national alert in place and experts warning of the potential for thousands of excess deaths.Sharma said the extreme heat should alert candidates to what was at stake. “Any candidate aspiring to be our next prime minister who doesn’t think we are facing a climate emergency needs to consider the temperatures we are seeing in the UK, across Europe and beyond,” he said. “No one should be in any doubt about how much worse this could get if we do not have a clear plan and continue to press for action during this critical decade.”Tory leadership: MPs to vote in third ballot, with Rishi Sunak buoyed by snap debate poll – liveRead more“We are already at 1.1C average warming above pre-industrial levels and we can already see the huge environmental, economic and very human costs being experienced across the world,” he added.He told the Guardian that the five remaining candidates for Tory leadership, and therefore prime minister, must show at Monday’s hustings that they understood the nature of the climate crisis and were prepared to respond with urgency.He said: “The question that every candidate needs to answer is do they support the manifesto on which we were elected in 2019, which very clearly sets out a commitment to net zero and to green growth, and that they will continue with this particular agenda and this manifesto commitment.”This would include the commitments made under Boris Johnson and a plan to push forward with renewable energy and decarbonising all sectors of the economy, Sharma made clear.“I hope every candidate will have read our 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution,” he said. “I hope every candidate will have read the government’s net zero strategy, our British energy security strategy. And I hope when they talk about green levies, they’ll also have understood what the makeup of green levies is.”Although all of the remaining candidates apart from Kemi Badenoch have endorsed the net zero target, there are doubts over whether they will push forward on the policies needed to achieve that goal. Several have hinted at weakening key policies, such as green levies on energy bills, which Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt said they would scrap, or at holding back on climate action.Rishi Sunak warned in the televised debate on Sunday night against going “too hard and too fast” on climate action. Tom Tugendhat appeared to pin his hopes on carbon capture and storage, which experts have said can play only a minor role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTSharma, speaking before the debate, said the green levies helped to reduce bills rather than increase them, and emphasised the urgency of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. “Some candidates have been lukewarm on this issue. And my response is that this is such a vital issue. Net zero is one of the clearest economic trends we have, and that’s reiterated by businesses in the UK and by businesses internationally,” he said.Net zero was good for the economy, and for the Tories’ electoral prospects, as well as for the planet, Sharma added. “This is about an environmental dividend, but it’s also about an economic dividend, and ultimately an electoral dividend as well,” he said. “If you look at all the polling that is out there, this is an issue that matters to all people, but also matters very much to people who vote Conservative.”With the UK still holding the presidency of the UN climate talks, until Egypt takes over in November at the Cop27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Sharma said it would be “incredibly damaging” for the UK’s international standing if the new prime minister weakened in any way on net zero.Sharma has also warned that if the final candidate chosen by Tory MPs and Conservative party members does not show clear commitment to pushing forward on net zero policy, he could resign. He said: “Anyone aspiring to lead our country needs to demonstrate that they take this issue incredibly seriously. I want to see candidates very proactively set out their support for a net zero agenda for green growth.”",

  "Football is all about creating dreams but even the most ambitious and imaginative young players require some initial inspiration.Before they can begin envisaging being part of a trophy-winning team or start dreaming about scoring goals galore, budding Lionesses need role models to whom they can relate.Women’s Euro 2022: your complete guide to all 368 playersRead moreThat is one of the many reasons why diversity is so important and why it is legitimate to question the England team’s whiteness. Doing so should not be seen as a criticism of a very good side or a very good manager in Sarina Wiegman but an acknowledgement that visibility matters.Young girls who cannot see anyone who looks like they do lack heroines to emulate – and that matters.Like England France have reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2022 but unlike the Lionesses their 23-woman squad contains 15 black or brown players. By contrast the Lionesses have only three black players: Jess Carter, Nikita Parris and Demi Stokes, with only Carter having, so far, had any game time.There is clearly a problem – but it has nothing to do with Wiegman’s Euro 2022 team sheets and everything to do with the pathways leading players to the England squad.The English female scouting system lacks sufficient bodies on the ground, the necessary resources and the imagination required to look in the right places. Why don’t chief scouts ask organisations like the charity Football Beyond Borders to help them identify gifted young players from non-conventional backgrounds?Demographics also come into things. Some areas – the north-east for example – are much whiter than others. Even so, scouts do not seem to be identifying promising young black players in much more diverse regions. Are they not looking in the right places? Do laziness or groupthink draw them to search in similar places? Or is it also partly about the WSL’s establishment in 2010?When I started playing, back in the days when the women’s game was still amateur, the London women’s teams, Arsenal, Chelsea, Charlton and Fulham, were quite diverse.Hope Powell, here preparing England for the 2005 Euros, is the only non-white coach Anita Asante worked with. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianPerhaps strangely, that has changed since 2010. Most England internationals now represent professional, and largely white, WSL teams. This was something that really struck me when I joined newly promoted Aston Villa in 2020 and realised that with players like me, Jamaica’s Shania Hayles and Elisha N’Dow we were the WSL’s most diverse side.Part of the problem stems from WSL teams having moved mainly to leafy new suburban or semi-rural training facilities away from cities in places like Surrey, Hertfordshire and Cheshire.This is the norm for many of their parent men’s Premier League clubs who, perhaps understandably, believe women’s teams should train in the same type of places. What they may not have thought out is that there’s an awful lot less money in the women’s game and many young black girls, who often live in inner cities, can struggle to reach out-of-town training grounds.Whereas a leading men’s club might arrange for a male academy player to be transported from school to training and then back home, that option almost certainly won’t be there for the girl whose parents are unable to ferry her back and forth. Young Premier League players are sometimes housed with host families able to create the right home environment to maximise their talent but, again, that does not happen to their WSL counterparts.While no group is homogenous and it is wrong to buy into the received wisdom that all young black players are disadvantaged and live in inner cities – clearly a sweeping generalisation – the suburbanisation of training facilities has evidently limited opportunities for both black and white girls from working-class backgrounds. By way of further complication, some schools have been very slow to introduce football as an option for girls.Another problem is the lack of black and brown faces on coaching staffs. I played for quite a few clubs over the years but, my former England manager Hope Powell apart, I never worked with a non‑white coach. That needs to change.Anita Asante celebrates with Shania Hayles after scoring for Aston Villa at Brighton in November 2020. Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty ImagesSome young black players were probably discouraged by the events of 2017 when the FA eventually apologised to Eni Aluko after her claims that England’s former manager Mark Sampson had directed racist comments towards her. When they saw Eni wasn’t believed at first, they maybe thought: “Why risk putting myself through that?”Then there is the lack of understanding about cultural barriers in some black, Asian and minority communities where there are often a lot of different pressures for girls to conform to gender norms. For instance, when Sport England began encouraging people from the south-east Asian community to take up cycling it did not initially realise that, in that culture, cycling was synonymous with poor people and, consequently, looked down on. Once officials explained why cycling in England is regarded very differently, a positive response followed.In football, too, coaches and administrators can sometimes be a bit lazy about understanding the cultural differences which would enable them to challenge perceptions and, sometimes, myths.But visibility – or the lack of it – remains the biggest problem. I was doing some punditry for the BBC last week when the presenter, Eilidh Barbour, initiated a discussion about the Lionesses’ lack of diversity.The Twitter backlash – with many users assuming, wrongly, we were criticising Wiegman’s England – suggested too many people are in denial about our diversity problem.They don’t realise everybody needs to be able to dream.",
  "A prosecutor on Monday urged jurors to sentence to death the gunman who killed 17 people in a mass shooting at a Florida high school in 2018.The penalty trial of Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz began on Monday, the deadliest US mass shooting to go before a jury.Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty last October to 17 counts of first-degree murder at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in the deaths of 14 students and three staff members there on 14 February 2018, and is now only contesting his sentence.Jurors must decide whether he gets the death penalty or life in prison without parole.Lead prosecutor Mike Satz had been expected to highlight Cruz’s brutality as he stalked a three-storey classroom building, firing his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle down hallways and into classrooms.Cruz sometimes walked back to wounded victims and killed them with a second volley of shots.On Monday afternoon, Satz told the Broward county jurors that Cruz committed “goal-directed, planned, systematic murder – mass murder – of 14 students, an athletic director, a teacher and a coach”.About three dozen family members of the victims were in the courtroom, sitting together in a roped-off section.Some shook their heads or wept as Satz described the massacre, naming each of the 17 people who died and another 17 injured in the attack.Dressed in a gray-and-black sweater and wearing a black face mask to limit the spread of coronavirus, Cruz slumped in his seat, looking down, for much of Satz’s statement. He appeared to write several notes and pass them to his lawyer.The trial for the former Stoneman Douglas student, expected to last about four months, was supposed to begin in 2020, but the Covid-19 pandemic and legal fights delayed it.Cruz in his guilty plea said he was “very sorry” and asked to be given a chance to help others. Satz said aggravating factors in the case including premeditation outweighed arguments for leniency including Cruz’s history of mental health problems.Referring to Cruz primarily as “the defendant” rather than by name, Satz said Cruz had planned to be a school shooter long before the attack. Jurors will see video of the crime taken by cameras at the school, Satz said.Teacher Brittany Sinitch, called as the prosecution’s first witness, described calling the 911 emergency number from her classroom. Her students were writing Valentine’s letters as characters from Romeo and Juliet as the attack began.“Almost instantly, I called 911. They couldn’t hear me over the sound of the gunshots; it was so loud,” she said.The Parkland shooting is the deadliest to reach trial in US history. Nine other gunmen who killed at least 17 people died during or immediately after their shootings, either by suicide or police gunfire.The suspect in the 2019 slaying of 23 people in an anti-immigrant shooting at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart is awaiting trial.",

  "Spanish customs agents seized a Picasso sketch worth more than €450,000 (£381,000) from a passenger who arrived at Ibiza airport without declaring the artwork, Spain’s customs office has said.Agents found the 1966 sketch, named Trois personnages, on 5 July in the suitcase of a man who arrived on the holiday island on a flight from Zurich, the office said in a statement.The passenger said the artwork was a simple copy and presented the agents with a handwritten receipt of 1,500 Swiss francs (£1280), which he said he had paid for the sketch.Found: the ‘how to draw’ books Pablo Picasso created for his daughter Read moreBut customs agents found another receipt in the bottom of his suitcase from a Zurich art gallery for 450,000 Swiss francs (€454,000) with a reference to a work by Pablo Picasso called Trois personnages.According to a preliminary analysis carried out by art experts, the sketch was indeed a work by the Spanish painter and “the price charged by the gallery is in line with the market price”, the statement said.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTThis first assessment would have to be confirmed by a “more exhaustive” analysis using “advanced techniques”, it added.The passenger faces possible charges of smuggling for failing to declare an object of value when he entered Spain.The customs office said they had singled him out for questioning after receiving a tip from their Swiss counterparts that he was transporting a piece of art in “suspicious” conditions.One of the most famous artists of the 20th century, Picasso spent most of his long life in France, dying there in 1973.",
  "I was chairing a Zoom event last week about carbon bombs, and how to defuse them. All over the world, as governments broadcast warm words to a warming planet, corporations are planning and lobbying for fossil fuel projects which, if they get off the ground, will sail us casually past our carbon targets – almost as if democracy itself were just a beach-body diet that everybody talked about and nobody intended to stick to. How to stop this nihilistic corporate greed? Legal avenues, direct action, political routes, or everything all at once?As I was doing this, a message popped up in the chat from Kjell Kühne, an academic and activist and one of the panellists: “Stop biting your nails please.” “Huh,” I thought, “weird thing to say to 846 people. How does he know they’re all biting their nails?” Then I realised it was a private message just to me. I considered messaging back: “Chum, when you stop making this incredibly compelling case about the climate apocalypse, I’ll stop biting my nails.” Then I remembered I was supposed to be chairing and got my head back on task.Climate anxiety is associated with gen Z. They have grown up learning about the crisis from primary school; by the time they get to secondary school, they’re frequently doing back-to-back disaster scenarios in previously sober subjects such as geography and design and technology . In their downtime, they take to TikTok to make droll content about their anxiety disorders. Really, the anxiety is universal, it’s just that older heads will try out any old bullshit to pretend not to feel it. When there’s a week like this one – everyone melting in their homes while five pitiful lightweights vie to run the country, all on the same “net zero so long as it costs nothing” ticket – the effort of pretending to be fine, fine, fine is, finally, greater than the discomfort of admitting you’re petrified.Climate-crisis denial is just a titchy chamber of delusion now, not so much a political stance as a refuge for people who aren’t coping. Climate-crisis anxiety denial, though, is everywhere. It must be, or we’d all be hiding, or rioting, or in a perpetual pendulum between the two. I will do anything to find a displacement emotion. I can lose hours raging against Brendan “green hysteria is out of control” O’Neill, even while I have my doubts that he’s a real person. And, even if he is, truthfully, what does one contrarian matter? I can roam around Twitter watching pile-ons against people who are not taking the heatwave seriously enough. I will happily do a deep dive on how to keep a dog cool, what proportion of Dubai energy use goes on air conditioning, or all the words there are in Darwin for “driven mad by heat”. No diversion is too small.I noticed something during the carbon bomb discussion, though – and, sure, it is hard to see inside another human’s head, especially over Zoom: but people who are constructively fighting the climate crisis seem to be a lot saner. One might think, intuitively, that full-on immersion in environmental politics would be a recipe for a nervous breakdown, and certainly those who are closest to the data are the least likely to make idiotic Panglossian remarks. But a steely calm settles over people when they know they’re doing everything they can. Across a huge range of personalities – off the top of my head, I’m thinking of Rupert Read, one of the early “Extinction Rebels”; Tessa Khan, who is a veteran climate lawyer; Greta Thunberg, who really doesn’t enjoy being mobbed and is mobbed wherever she goes; Vanessa Nakate, one of sunniest people I’ve ever met, who is in round-the-clock discussions about mass starvation – there’s a common thread, a sense that they have found peace through purpose. The answer to terror, and I’m not preaching, I’m just saying this to myself out loud, is to do more.\nZoe Williams is a Guardian columnist\n",
  "When Joe lost his wife, Debbie, to breast cancer in July 2012, he was devastated. “The earth moved under my feet. As a family, we didn’t recognise the full extent of the devastation until years later,” he says. “It’s not something you can comprehend when you’re going through it.” At the time, he was living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with his two children, aged nine and 12. To cope with the pain and difficulties of his new life, he turned to blogging. “I would sit at my computer and words would just come out. I have no idea why I started, I just needed an outlet and it felt cathartic.”Not long after he began writing, his blog was recommended to Kim, whose husband, Jack, had recently died from a brain tumour. “I was experiencing exactly the same, bringing up two children and juggling the demands at work,” she says. Grief was a big topic on the blog, but Joe also touched on other issues, like coping with milestones, such as the children’s first day back at school. “That was the post that really struck me. When the kids returned to school, I’d see these forms where my husband was listed alongside me. It was really hard.”One day, when Kim was visiting Jack in the cemetery, she noticed that Debbie was buried next to him. “We’d never met but I recognised her surname from the blog,” she says. In late September, she emailed Joe to thank him for the posts he was sharing. “She had signed it saying that her husband was buried next to my wife,” says Joe. “It felt like I was hit with a lightning bolt.”A few weeks later, they met in person at a local support event for young widowers. They formed a friendship, regularly meeting up in a group. “I was into running at the time and Joe came running with me and my friends,” says Kim. In November, they went out for coffee after completing a 5k run and ended up chatting for hours.Joe and Kim on a trip to Zion national park in Utah in 2021.“There was an attraction there, but we didn’t act on it,” says Joe. “I remember feeling like I wanted to hold her hand, though.” They began to meet more regularly and found they could confide in each other. They started dating in early 2013, but kept it from their families. “There’s a lot of taboos around how quickly you can get into a new relationship when you’re grieving,” says Joe.They met whenever they could and supported each other through their grief. “We were calling each other in the middle of the night when we felt overwhelmed,” says Kim. In April 2014, they shared their relationship with their families. Although it came as a shock, they were supportive. At the end of 2015, Kim and Joe moved in together with all their children. “My vision was quite Brady Bunch, but it was a bit more like the Osbournes,” laughs Joe. “Now we go on vacations together.”Joe and Kim love the outdoors and going for long walks. “We’ve done lots of hiking through national parks and I don’t think I would have done that without him,” says Kim.Kim works for the government, while Joe has a job in finance. As well as enjoying time together, they also honour the lives of their former partners. “We’re getting married in a few weeks and we’ll have two spare chairs for them as a tribute,” says Kim. “They’re for ever part of our lives.”Joe says there is no force in the universe that can stop Kim when she has put her mind to something. “We really complement each other. It seems like our meeting was arranged by our partners, like they’re watching over us.”When it comes to day-to-day life, Kim appreciates Joe’s passion. “Whether it’s the kids, or his writing, he puts everything into it.

  "Before we get to the book, a heads up that the Guardian’s beautiful puzzle supplement on Saturday contained, alongside proper puzzles from Carpathian and Picaroon (of whom more below), my own “The most Guardian crossword ever”.The Serbian writer Milorad Pavić was not fond of a beginning, a middle and an end. One of his plays takes the form of a restaurant menu. His most famous novel, translated into various languages, is structured as a dictionary. Then there’s the crossword one, Landscape Painted With Tea, which comes with the instructions “How to solve this book across” and “How to solve this book down”.Landscape Painted With Tea, a novel.You could call it the life story of an architect, but that’s not really its point. The book is about thinking of people as belonging in two different groups, as unalike as across and down. It’s also a kind of game. The trick is to work out what is expected of you the reader – and I believe I can help.Like Cain’s Jawbone, the whodunnit by the Observer crossword setter Torquemada (AKA Edward Powys Mathers, who died in 1939), you choose what order to read the book’s various bits. But while Cain’s Jawbone has a solution, Pavić’s invitation to “solve this book” – along with the lined blank pages he leaves for the reader to “write in the denouement” – is still more of a game. Or, at least, if there is a solution, it’s not of the “the murderer was X” variety.Pavić’s goal is altogether grander: to invent a new way of reading, which he hopes will help us to defy time and the inevitability of death. Right. But is it enjoyable? It is, sometimes.‘A novel for crossword fans’.My experience began with some extra bafflement, thanks to the unfamiliar Serbian-style grids (see image, left).Happily, I could turn to the Guardian’s expert in experimental fiction, the Serbo-Croat language and crosswords, the setter and novelist Picaroon. How do Serbian crosswords work, I asked. Picaroon says that some resemble American puzzles and some, in a format called Skandinavka, look like French mots fléchés, where the definitions are inside the grid …There’s also a format called ‘bela ukrštenica’ (‘white crossword’), which has numbers for each row and column and you have to work out how to fit the solutions in the columns/rows based on crossing letters (so slightly in the direction of a ‘carte blanche’ style British advanced puzzle, although you do know which column or row the words go in).OK, but it seems that as well as the grids, the culture of crosswording is different. One of the many ways that the narrator of Landscape Painted With Tea splits the world into two is by distinguishing between solvers who enjoy “well-arranged crossings” and those who appreciate “actual words”. Can Serbian puzzles, I asked Picaroon, have words that aren’t definitely words?There’s not really a standard reference work like Chambers or Collins which is considered a kind of crossword bible. What’s more, there doesn’t seem to be strict editorial oversight of puzzles, so things like (comprehensible) neologisms or pretty unusual inflected forms of words crop up, leading to a few raised eyebrows.With that information, I now understood how to approach this book. I was wrong to think of it as a collection of parables, jokes and asides given structure and meaning by the crossword device. It’s a collection of parables, jokes and asides that the crossword device renders even more ambiguous.If you haven’t read it, and if you remain tempted, my other tip is: you have to work your way through it very, very slowly.Our next bookHave His Carcase by Dorothy L Sayers, in the Guardian Bookshop.If we were to do some Pavić-style dividing of people into, say, those who appreciate postmodern attempts to defy the inevitability of death, and those who want to know who commited the murder, that might suggest that our next book should be a whodunnit.And it is!

  "One question is dominating the energy industry: will Vladimir Putin turn the tap back on? This week the Kremlin-controlled energy firm Gazprom shut off gas supplies through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for maintenance until 21 July, having already cut its output to less than 40% of capacity. Now there are growing concerns that the Russian president may simply refuse to reactivate it.This week energy executives at the Aurora consultancy’s conference in Oxford were asked to vote on whether the supplies would return. A forest of confident arms shot up for “yes”, a similar amount for “no”. Only Putin knows the answer.Fears for gas supplies have led European nations to rapidly fill up their storage capacity before the winter. Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of conducting “gas blackmail”. By contrast, nations with closer links to Russia, including Belarus and Turkey, have seen little disruption.MapAlthough Moscow had a record of restricting gas flows to Europe as part of past disputes with Ukraine – including in 2005-06, 2009 and 2017 – many in the industry had assumed that because the Kremlin kept supplies flowing throughout the cold war, it would not resort to cutting off its largest market. However, Ben van Beurden, CEO of Shell, said this week that Putin has now shown “he is able and willing to weaponise supplies”.The strategy has the apparent aims of weakening Kyiv’s allies and, potentially, turning nations on one another. This week Hungary’s pro-Putin prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said it would halt gas exports to its neighbours. The move undermines a regulation that made solidarity among European countries mandatory to prevent the supply cuts seen after the 2017 Russia-Ukraine gas dispute.Less gas sold in Europe means less money for the Kremlin’s war chest, and the EU has committed to cutting Russian imports by two-thirds by year end on that basis. However, despite EU leaders agreeing a partial embargo on Russian oil, any outright ban on its gas appears unlikely given how much many of its members rely on it. So which countries are most vulnerable to Putin’s pressure as he turns the screw?Map showing how reliance on Russian gas varies throughout Europe. GermanyThe European economic powerhouse has been left most exposed by the sudden lack of Russian gas after the closure of Nord Stream 1, which runs from Vyborg, north-west of St Petersburg, under the sea to Germany’s Baltic coast.The German economy minister, Robert Habeck, says the Kremlin is using gas “as a weapon” and admits his country had made a “grave political mistake” in becoming too dependent on Russian supplies. Germany imported 59.2bn cubic meters of gas through Nord Stream 1 in 2021 and had hoped to double that via a new sister pipeline, Nord Stream 2, but suspended those plans days before the invasion of Ukraine.Germany has hastily tried to wean itself off Russian gas to distance itself from Putin since the war. Meanwhile, Gazprom cut supplies through Nord Stream 1 to 40% of its capacity in mid-June. As a result, Germany’s dependence on Russian gas has fallen from 55% of total consumption to 35% since the war. But the government has still been forced to declare a gas crisis, asking industrial users to slash usage and encouraging councils to turn off traffic lights at night, cut the use of air conditioning and stop lighting up historic buildings.Investors are at their most pessimistic over the German economy since the throes of the eurozone debt crisis in 2011, amid fears it could slump into recession.ItalyItalians are currently battling a heatwave but staying warm this winter remains high on the agenda in a country with the oldest population in Europe. Russian gas imports accounted for 18% of consumption before the war in Ukraine and are largely piped via the Trans Austria gas pipeline.Power group Eni said this week that Gazprom would cut supplies to Italy by a third, on top of cuts of 60% since war broke out. Confindustria, the association representing Italian industries, has said a complete halt could see its GDP drop by 2%. Rising bond yields indicate markets are increasingly concerned over the country’s abilities to repay its huge debts.Italy’s gas storage sites are now about 60% full and plans have been floated to ask consumers to turn down their heating this winter and spend less time showering.GraphicSlovakiaSPP, the main Slovak gas importer, receives most of its gas from Russia and even Zelenskiy acknowledges the Slovaks cannot immediately cut off that source. SSP has managed to ramp up liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from Norway and other nations until the end of the year. A new Polish-Slovak interconnector pipeline, due to open later this year, is also being tested.AustriaAustria gets 80% of its gas from Russia and its storage depots meet just 39% of its annual needs. The government has pledged to spend €6.6bn on building up reserves although Haidach, one of Europe’s biggest underground gas reservoirs, is unlikely to be filled due to tensions between its joint owners – a German and an Austrian firm and Gazprom.The NetherlandsThe Dutch energy ministry has said the country has managed to meet its goal of ending its need for Russian gas for domestic use. However, as a huge storage and transport hub, it could take a knock from reduced flows. In May, Gazprom halted gas supplies to Dutch company GasTerra after it refused to meet Kremlin demands that all gas be paid for in roubles.GraphicFranceFrance is less dependent than some of its neighbours on Russia, which supplies about 17% of its gas. But replacing energy output is complicated by the fact many French nuclear plants, which could have picked up the slack, are out of action because of maintenance and repairs. Russia briefly cut off supplies to France in June and Paris’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, this week described a Russian gas cutoff as the “most likely scenario”.He said the country would initially ask households and businesses to cut energy consumption and then later look into constructing new infrastructure such as a floating LNG plant. French tyre giant Michelin said it had converted its boilers to ensure they are capable of running on oil as well as gas.SpainThe Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, is facing geopolitical tensions over the country’s gas supplies on all fronts. His decision to support Morocco in a dispute over Western Sahara prompted a reduction in gas flows from Algeria, which has now been overtaken by Russia as Spain’s second largest supplier, behind the US. Russian supplies are entirely LNG while Algeria’s gas is largely piped to Spain.Sanchez has talked up Spain’s existing facilities – the country accounts for 37% of the EU’s capacity for re-gasification, where LNG is turned back into natural gas – so could ramp up exports into the rest of Europe. Spain and neighbouring Portugal have also introduced a temporary cap on the wholesale price of gas.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST.PolandRussia cut off Poland and Bulgaria in late April after they refused to comply with its demands to pay in rubles. Poland had received around half of its gas from Russia, with 9.9bn cubic meters of the 20bn it uses a year coming via the Yamal pipeline. However, it relies on coal for most of its power and has already filled up its gas storage sites.A 1996 contract with Gazprom had been due to end this year and Poland had no intention of renewing it. Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at consultancy ICIS, said: “Poland is not in a bad position because it has not trusted Russia for many years. It began this conversation about security of energy supply much earlier than other countries.”",
  "Erik ten Hag has claimed Cristiano Ronaldo could stay at Manchester United beyond the expiry of his contract with the club and that the Portuguese is capable of fitting into his high-pressing style.Speculation has swirled around Ronaldo’s future ever since it was revealed that he had made clear to those inside Old Trafford of his desire to leave. The 37-year-old has one year remaining on his deal and having not joined up for United’s pre-season tour of the far east and Australia due to personal reasons, it was expected he would be granted a departure from the club he rejoined less than a year ago before the start of the upcoming campaign.Erik ten Hag: ‘I want to play in a certain way and Ronaldo can contribute to that’Read moreHowever Ten Hag has made it clear since becoming United manager that Ronaldo is part of his plans for the 2022-23 season and went further in an interview ahead of United’s game against Crystal Palace at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Tuesday by suggesting the player may remain in situ beyond then, too. “I am well informed – he also has an option [for a further season],” the Dutchman said. “Yes [Ronaldo could stay beyond this season]. Of course I have signed here for three years, but in football it’s short-term as well. We have to win from the start. So I don’t look that far ahead.”A Manchester United fan shows their love for Cristiano Ronaldo outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where United face Crystal Palace on Tuesday. Ronaldo will not be there as he is not part of United’s pre-season tour of the far east and Australia. Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Getty ImagesTen Hag has still not spoken with Ronaldo but made clear he remains relaxed about the situation, as well as with the player’s lack of preparation for the new season. “We all know Ronaldo is a top professional and will be fit, that is the last concern I have,” he insisted.The manager also feels sure Ronaldo can be the spearhead of his attack despite statistics from last season relating to pressing, sprinting and work rate suggesting the veteran is a bad fit for the way Ten Hag had Ajax playing and will no doubt want to replicate at Old Trafford. “Cristiano is capable of doing that [pressing from the front]. In his career he has shown everything,” said Ten Hag. “We want to play in a certain way. A top player can contribute and Ronaldo is an absolute top player in our squad.”Somewhat contradicting himself, however, Ten Hag also suggested that incorporating Ronaldo into his team will inevitably mean compromising his principles. “The players dictate the way you play. Especially players who score goals because they are extremely important for a team,” said the 52-year-old. “You construct your team around them.”",
  "The UK government may be undermining its commitments to end deforestation overseas because of conflicts over trade policy, the Guardian has learned.A war of words is raging within the government over deforestation and trade, with green campaigners warning that a proposed policy could have dire consequences for efforts to stop illegal logging.Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, is believed to want to relax tariffs for goods including palm oil from Malaysia, a country of top concern over deforestation. The relaxation would be part of a broader push for trade deals with developing countries that the government is pursuing in the wake of Brexit.The UK wants to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes Malaysia, by dropping generic trade tariffs. Negotiations began under the former trade secretary Liz Truss, who is running as a Tory leadership candidate.However, the removal of tariffs without any green strings attached would undercut the UK’s parallel efforts to end illegal deforestation overseas, one of the centrepieces of the deal that ministers forged at the UN Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year.Sam Lawson, the director of the UK campaign group Earthsight, who has spent many years investigating deforestation for palm oil in Malaysia, said: “This proposal to slash tariffs on Malaysian palm oil without any conditions regarding the devastating deforestation those imports are known to cause is utter madness. Instead of addressing the cost of living crisis, this government is using it as a hollow excuse for ditching its own climate goals in a craven effort to get another trade agreement under its belt.”The UK’s Environment Act, which was passed last year, makes provision for due diligence when companies import goods, including palm oil, from overseas countries where deforestation is rife. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is currently consulting on the exact form this due diligence will take in practice.Fury as government waters down post-Brexit food standardsRead moreIf import regulations are relaxed for Malaysia without due diligence safeguards in place, it could give countries where deforestation is happening the hope of avoiding any of the sanctions provided for in the Environment Act, rendering the government’s green pledges toothless. Countries such as Indonesia and Brazil would be likely to press for similar deals, according to campaigners.The Guardian has seen a strongly worded letter to Trevelyan from Zac Goldsmith, an environment minister and member of the House of Lords, querying her stance. He cited research showing that liberalising trade in the way the Department for International Trade (DIT) is considering for Malaysia would yield an economic benefit of only about £1.38m for the whole of the UK.“If we go for the full liberalisation, we are choosing to U-turn on the very core of our Cop26 messaging on the importance of forests,” he wrote. “We obviously cannot continue leading global efforts to break the link between commodities and deforestation if in our own trade policy we are encouraging the opposite.”In the letter, dated 28 June, he added: “It is clear this isn’t an authentic ‘cost of living’ decision; it is a values decision. And I am struggling to understand who we are trying to appeal to with these appalling values? Or how we are supposed to defend this entirely indefensible position, for example in Lib Dem target seats?”Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe DIT said it could not comment on live negotiations. A spokesperson told the Guardian: “We are firmly committed to maintaining our high domestic standards of environmental protection in trade agreements, and CPTPP includes environmental provisions to support these objectives. The UK has convened over 25 major trading countries to agree action to protect forests through the forest, agriculture and commodity trade dialogue, and is taking forward measures under the Environment Act to make it illegal for businesses to use key commodities if they have not been produced in line with local laws protecting forests and other natural ecosystems.”The production of palm oil, which is widely used in an array of supermarket goods, from cosmetics to bread, is a major cause of deforestation in many countries in south-east Asia. Attempts to encourage more sustainable production of palm oil have so far made little progress.Lawson said: “UK consumers don’t want to be associated with destroying orangutan habitat or human rights abuses overseas. The giant agricultural firms and supermarket chains involved in the trade in goods from Malaysia can easily absorb the tiny cost of ensuring this out of their own profits.”Current UK tariffs for Malaysian palm oil vary from 2% for crude palm oil to 12% for the more processed versions.",
  "For months the British government has floated the idea of unilaterally breaking the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, part of the withdrawal treaty it agreed with the European Union. That would undermine the Good Friday agreement, reanimate the prospect of sectarian violence and damage the UK’s international reputation. Such action demands a weighty justification and ministers have one, with the attorney general arguing that “Northern Ireland’s economy is lagging behind the rest of the UK”.Except it’s not. Statistics show that Northern Ireland is outstripping every part of the UK except London.In recent years politicians have repeatedly based the case for historic changes on lies. These have ranged from the infamous “Brexit bus”, which promised £350m a week for the NHS, to government framing of recent rail strikes as “selfish” because, as Boris Johnson told one interviewer: “Train drivers are on £59,000 and some are on £70,000.” (The average wage of a striker is below £36,000.)

Truth is a great leveller.The problem is that our public discourse has become increasingly divorced from reality. The pollster Ipsos Mori conducts regular surveys on what the British public believes about the facts behind frequently discussed issues. In one memorable study it discovered that, in the words of one headline, “the British public is wrong about nearly everything”. Among the concerns was benefit fraud: people surveyed estimated that around £24 of every £100 of benefits was fraudulently claimed, whereas the actual figure was 70p. When asked about immigration, people estimated that 31% of the population were born outside the UK, when in truth it was 13%.Members of parliament have played a prominent role in getting us to this point. They make and vote on laws, help set the political agenda and influence the national conversation. Of course, politicians have always had a tendentious relationship with the truth. From the Zinoviev letter to the Profumo affair, history is littered with scandals that result from lies being exposed. Profumo resigned because he misled parliament once. Today’s ministers regularly do the same with impunity.Boris Johnson is merely the latest prime minister to embrace lying for political gainCommentators often paint Johnson as uniquely mendacious, but he is merely the latest prime minister to embrace lying for political gain. David Cameron won two elections by misleading the country about the causes of the financial crash and the economic impacts of austerity. Theresa May built her early career in government on dubious anti-immigration rhetoric, notably the lie that one immigrant had been allowed to stay in the country because he had a pet cat.Democracy cannot function properly in this environment and an existential problem demands a radical solution. So, MPs (and peers in the House of Lords) should be formally required to tell the truth: in the debating chamber, on TV, in print and on social media. To publish a statement that wilfully or negligently misrepresents information should be classed as misconduct in public office (a criminal offence). In other words: we need a truth law.Ensuring the offence captures both “wilful” and “negligent” misrepresentation will obviate spurious defences such as Johnson’s claim that he thought the Downing Street parties were “work events”. With researchers and civil servants at their disposal, parliamentarians have no excuse for misrepresenting the facts. Even so, I suggest that they should not be prosecuted if they correct the record and apologise in parliament within seven days.Radical as it may seem, we already have all the tools to make this work within established law. “Publish” has a clear legal meaning (essentially “to make public”). Tests of wilfulness or negligence are frequently applied across civil and criminal law. Determining whether someone has “misrepresented information” (ie, not told the truth) is often the core business of the courts. The penalty for misconduct can go all the way up to life imprisonment. While some may find that rather satisfying, I suggest limiting it, in this class of cases, to a fine. The courts should also have the power to refer an offender to the Standards Committee for further parliamentary sanction.The big idea: are we responsible for the things we do wrong? Read moreI imagine that there will be two main objections to this idea. First, it may have a chilling effect on parliamentarians’ free expression. But parliamentarians are not ordinary citizens. They hold a special position of trust and power, which they assume voluntarily, and for which they are rewarded handsomely. It’s right that that they should be subject to stricter rules. Many professions limit the freedom of expression of their members in the public interest. As a barrister I am subject to “truth telling” rules which, if breached, could end my career (and potentially lead to a prosecution for contempt of court). Politicians’ words have more influence than barristers’, so it’s fair to subject them to more exacting standards.Second, any truth law would breach “parliamentary privilege”. This guarantees that MPs will not be prosecuted for anything they say in parliament. That rule was developed to stop monarchs persecuting their political opponents. It was never intended to be a licence to lie. We now have an independent prosecution authority and independent courts: it’s time we addressed today’s challenges to democracy, not ones that were last relevant centuries ago.My proposal won’t eradicate lying in public life. But it’s an important first step. Imagine, for a moment, that we could genuinely trust our elected representatives. That shouldn’t be a utopian ideal – and in the law, we have the means to make it a reality.
